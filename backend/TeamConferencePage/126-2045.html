Nov 09 2011:  <b>5 Star recruit Hank Tripp joins Lions</b> - <i>by g10rsh on March 25th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
Hank Tripp signed today with Columbia, when asked why he was leaving chicago he simply said "I want to play in the NBA, and Columbia knows how to get guys to that level."<br />
<br />
Reggie "Make Millions" McMillian was seen doing his trademark ecstatic happy screamcrying lap around the facilities after getting the final confirmation.<br />
<br />
He looks to perform as a well above average Scoring Power Forward with great rebounding capability.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_110'></a>
Nov 27 2003:  <b>Cody Moore Commits to Columbia</b> - <i>by g10rsh on January 6th, 2019</i> <br /><br />
After last years recruiting debacle head coach Reggie McMillan was seen skipping up and down the halls, his chants of "We got him we got him!" reverberating through the building.<br />
<br />
Cody Moore, the current #1 on top prospects has committed to join the Lions next year. He has had a long relationship with the coach, who began recruiting him as a freshman. the coach even red-shirted his best starters this year so that Cody would have better players to play with for longer.<br />
<br />
Having only one scholarship to give out this year means the recruiting squad can move onto looking into juniors for next years crop.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_38'></a>
Oct 04 2001:  <b>New Year, New Roster, Same Problems</b> - <i>by g10rsh on September 1st, 2018</i> <br /><br />
Today after just a few days of practice Columbia Athletics head coach posted the expected depth chart for the start of the season, as well as redshirt orders.<br />
<br />
PG: Joseph Cooper (SR)<br />
SG: Dave Rooney (RS JR)<br />
SF: Chuck Waldrip (FR)<br />
PF: Blake Daniels (SR)<br />
C : Dion Gardner (JR)<br />
<br />
Backup Gaurd: Alexander Patterson (FR)<br />
Backup Forward: Micheal Martin (FR)<br />
<br />
Red Shirts:<br />
Derrick Booker (FR)<br />
Alexander Patterson (FR)<br />
<br />
Cooper, Daniels, and Gardner return from a squad that last year managed to post a winning record, but not much else, Cooper will be making the transition from  SF to PG. When asked about the new responsibilities all he had to say was "It's about time, somebody has to turn this offense around." However This reporter has heard from sources close to the head coach that he is actually only excited about the two new starters and the freshman who will be coming in off the bench. If they improve well they may be starting by the end of the year. Chuck Waldrip looks to be a future longterm captain, and after Dave Rooney's redshirt year he looks ready to come in and be our main point scorer on offense.<br />
<br />
There was also drama, As the long estranged Patterson brothers, who had arranged to come here to play together saw the depth chart and realized that while one would be playing a large role in the offense right off the bat, the other would be asked to redshirt. When asked for comment Head Coach Reggie Mcmillan had this to say. "It's simple honestly, if I had options they'd both be redshirting, but Jamal is the best we have to fill a necessary hole on offense, I plan to redshirt him at sometime during his career here as well, so they should stop griping and focus on making sure they are ready to dominate in league II by then."<br /><br /><br />

<br />
Coach McMillan sees a bright future for this kid. "He's gonna be our inside man. He absolutely rocks the post, cleans every board, and plays tireless defense."<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_2'></a>

<br />
