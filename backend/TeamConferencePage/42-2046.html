<h3>Press Releases:</h3>
<a id='releases_4324'></a>
Mar 10 2045:  <b></b> - <i>by The Immortal on May 22nd, 2025</i> <br /><br />
*NBA tonight music plays*  "Good evening ladies and gentleman, this is NBA tonight and we have a special guest joining us who we saw in the front row at the game. Let's introduce Coach Miles for conference winners NC State. Welcome Coach Miles!" Coach Miles smiles proudly. "Thanks Terry glad to be here." "Absolutely coach... *interview proceeds for 5 minutes* So coach tell us what you've heard about this new team called Goldey."  Coach Miles laughs as he says, "Well they're not new, it's just the first time anyone has ever heard of them because this is the first year they've ever done anything since El Jefe took over. I think they've gone 66-140 overall and 55-95 in conference before this season with him. So I mean honestly he needs to post 5 press releases instead of 3 for those scrubs."<br /><br /><br />

Mar 09 2045:  <b>Tournament Time</b> - <i>by The Immortal on May 21st, 2025</i> <br /><br />
"Good morning Wolfpack faithful! John Bellows is back with another exclusive for State Sports and WKYA radio sitting down with conference champion Coach Miles for his post-regular season chat. Good morning Coach and congrats on the conference championship!" *Coach Miles leans back in his chair and lays his hand on his new Conference Title trophy* "Well Jim we did what we expected to do. We won the title and put our stamp on this conference and promoted to III while never really being challenged. We had a couple good tries by some of these other teams but honestly they're just not at our level, even when we are playing a SG at point, no backup point, no back up PF or backup Center. Now it's tourney time and I'm giving the boys a rest. We will see you all soon." Coach Miles says into the camera. <br /><br /><br />

Feb 23 2045:  <b>The South Rides Again</b> - <i>by The Immortal on May 17th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
I wonder how long it will take for those guys to figure out Immortal wasn't my first team lol<br />
<br />
"Good morning Wolfpack Nation. This is your sports report John Bellows checking in with a special report. As I made my way back to the dorm I saw the coach's car outside the arena so I went in to investigate. I found Coach Miles standing at half court smoking his cigar. He had one thing to say, and I quote, 'That win reminded me of the good old days.' This is John Bellows signing off until next time!"<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4301'></a>
Feb 02 2045:  <b>Riding again</b> - <i>by The Immortal on May 10th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
"Good evening folks! This is John Bellows again on WKYA Wolfpack Radio, here's a short clip from our discussion with Coach Miles." *Video starts* "So Coach another win." Coach Miles leans back in his chair and puffs his cigar as he says, "Yeah we had a tough couple games with some of the better teams in the conference. But I knew we had a couple scrubs coming up and one D3 team masquerading as a D1 squad. So we expected some easy wins and we got em. Now our focus is on the rest of our schedule and closing out strong." *video ends* "Coach Miles had some more choice words about that D3 squad but apparently some whiny thin-skinned losers cried to the commish the last time trying to get us shut down, so we decided to cut those from the clip. Anyway, we will see you next time Wolfpack Nation! John Bellows signing off."<br /><br /><br />

Dec 31 2044:  <b>NC State 108 - Bates 89 Easy Money</b> - <i>by The Immortal on May 1st, 2025</i> <br /><br />
"Somebody turn this thing on hurry u... oh we're live?" John fixes his hair, "This is your favorite sports reporter John Bellows back with another report from the North Carolina State Wolfpack's arena after another blowout win. The game was chippy with some hard fouls and multiple guys fouling out. The Wolfpack's press conference was what you would expect from a confident team who won without their best defender, but as the Bobcats were finishing their presser, the big man Center for State Mike Denney busted into the room and grabbed the microphone away from Joe Hopkins as his teammates came rushing in behind him to pull them away but before they could Denney could be heard saying, "Somebody come pick these scrubs up and get them out of my arena and take em back to wherever the heck Bates is."<br /><br /><br />
