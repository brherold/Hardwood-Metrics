Mar 05 2033:  <b>Kearney Takes Conference Title</b> - <i>by squad on July 17th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Only 2 years after going 0-30 in conference play the Lopers have redeemed themselves by season long consistency and taking the title!  Lonnie "Lights Out" Albright, a red shirt Sophomore led the team with his 20.8 points per game.  Red Shirt Junior Irving "Ugly" Lugli, was solid inside averaging 11.6 rebounds per game.  The two stars each were POTG 12 times during the season.  Now onto the conference tourney and Division 2 national championship!<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_2860'></a>
Nov 18 2028:  <b>Terry Spears Named First UNK member of the Hall of Fame!</b> - <i>by squad on November 5th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
UNK will honor Terry "Harpoon" Spears at Opening Night of the 2029 Conference Season as the First member of the UNK Hall of Fame.  Harpoon was a rebounding and defensive machine averaging 10.9 rebounds per game over his career.  He has the three highest season rebounding records and is 3rd overall in scoring with 2,224 points over his career. He led the Lopers to the final 16 and was named all conference his junior and senior years.  The 2018 season was magical and Harpoon was the catalyst, said former coach Royce Carson.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_2117'></a>
Oct 13 2022:  <b>Even Doofus Got Minutes</b> - <i>by squad on November 24th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
UNK’s exhibition games have resulted in 2 solid wins and allowed Coach Cason to play a lot of players. He even allowed Eddie “Doofus” Marcus to play in the opener.  Per Cason “Usually a walk on with his basketball skills is on the team to help the team GPA.  However, in his case, the scouts had him rated a 0 in IQ.  I think they rounded up!.  It was a miracle he only had 2 turnovers in his 3 minutes of playing time.  However, it was fun to hear the crowd chant “Doofus, Doofus” to encourage me to put him in the game”<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1590'></a>
Mar 09 2018:  <b>UNK Survives a Nail-Biter- Beats Northern Florida 74-72</b> - <i>by squad on March 31st, 2021</i> <br /><br />
Kearney led for a total of 25 seconds, but managed to pull out the win in dramatic fashion. Rarely used Sophomore Hank Murray put up a 3 pointer with 16 seconds to go that rattled around but didn't go in.  However, the rebounding machine, Terry Spears, was there to pick up the offensive rebound and get the ball to Gabriel Gilbert who was fouled in the act of shooting. Despite poor shooting throughout, Gilbert made both free throws and the Lopers advance to play Quinnipiac in the semi-finals.  Coach Cason looked frazzled and practically hugged Hank Murray while saying "Hank rarely plays- Hell, he probably isn't sure how to check into the game, but he was big- 5 minutes of playing time, 9 points, a rebound and an assist and plus 14 in those 5 minutes.  Some might say I am an idiot for not playing hime more!"<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1578'></a>
Mar 03 2018:  <b>Senior Day a Success for UNK- Pummel WVW 87-60</b> - <i>by squad on March 29th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
UNK finished their regular season with a convincing 87-60 win over West Virginia Weslyeyan. The Lopers were led by Seniors; Gilbert, Spears, Bartolini and Peterson who combined for 46 points. Coach Cason was emotional in the postgame celebration stating "I only got to coach those guys one year, but it was one of my best year's ever.  Even better than the year I had six girls who said yes, when I asked them out on dates!" Spears and Gilbert will be recognized as two of the best to play for the Lopers and everyone hopes they can continue their success through the conference and D3 tourney.<br /><br /><br />
