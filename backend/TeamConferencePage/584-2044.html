Mar 11 2022:  <b>Another Year, Another Frustrating Season</b> - <i>by CloseToAverage on November 10th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
Though we attempted to rally back in the second half, our team couldn't hang with Louisiana-Lafayette.  Credit to their team, as they are truly a legit threat.  As for our team, a lot of change can be expected.  We will likely be changing our head coach for the failure to capitalize on Henry Keck's prime, and the failure to continue Derek Goodman's development.  We will see who takes this role soon.  Obviously, next year will be Goodman's last on the team, so we want to make it special.  We hope that with a new coach, an outstanding junior cast to support him, and better development skills that we will be able to finally make something special happen.  Until then, enjoy the last moments of the duo of Henry Keck and Derek Goodman.  GO HAWKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />

Mar 10 2022:  <b>Big Second Half Wins First Round Matchup</b> - <i>by CloseToAverage on November 9th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
At the beginning of the game, it was looking to be a nail biter against Georgia College.  It was close all the way through the first half, and when it was over, Georgia College had a one point lead.  It stayed back and forth in the second half until there were 9 minutes left to play.  Georgia had a 4 point lead and seemed to start pulling away.  But our guys rallied after a timeout, going on an 18-0 run that put us up by 14.  By that point, we knew we had it, finishing the game off with a score of 84-61.  Now we play one of the best teams in Division 3, Louisiana-Lafayette.  They have had a stellar 33-8 season and are looking to be one of the best teams in this year's D3 tournament.  We are not one of the eight teams that have beat them this year, but that means nothing now.  Our guys will do whatever it takes to win this game, and with all of the upsets that have happened in the tournament, it could be an easier road than usual to the Conference Playoff Championship.  Nevertheless, we have to win this game to make it there, and that is no easy task.  But it is one we are ready and willing to take on.  GO HAWKS!!!!!!! <br /><br /><br />

Mar 10 2022:  <b>Even More Frustration</b> - <i>by CloseToAverage on November 9th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
It has been yet another frustrating, inconsistent year for our Indiana Univ. of Pennsylvania Hawks.  Though it wasn't because of injuries, it was because of coaching.  We feel that we have enough evidence to say that Sandy Moe is not the guy for us.  We will more than likely be releasing him this offseason.  This is due to the underperformances of our players this season.  Specifically, Henry Keck has had a bad year.  He has taken less shots, and shot a worse percentage despite improving a lot.  While other people have flourished like James McGraw, it has not lead to a lot of success for our team.  Hopefully we can turn this around and make another great run in the conference tournament.  This year we play Georgia College in the first round.  We played them three times this year, with us winning two and them winning one.  We are prepared for a battle.  A battle that we will win.  GO HAWKS!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />

Oct 20 2021:  <b>Offseason</b> - <i>by CloseToAverage on September 30th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
This offseason was not nearly as jam packed as last year's, but it was still a good one.  First, we had to say goodbye to two walk-ons Geoffrey Childs and Paul Benoit.  Even though they almost never played, its still tough to see them go.  But what really hurt was to see Dustin Caudill, our very solid power forward, go, and of course it was really hard to see the legendary Richard Spaulding leave.  He may not have been the best player on the team, but he always inspired everyone to do their best.  He is a hard guy to replace.  With all of that being said, we feel that we have found a guy who could take that role in the future: Kyle Herrington.  He is really talented, and we look forward to seeing what he can do for us.  Along with the addition of Herrington, we added a raw coaching prospect in Brent Lunsford.  We feel that with as young as he is, he could have a lot of potential to be a great coach.  Now, we look ahead to a very big year for us, since this is the last year that we'll get to see the incredible pairing of Derek Goodman and Henry Keck.  They've been with us through thick and thin, and I think we should repay them for all of their hard work with the first ever team to go to the tournament.  It's a very exciting year for us, and as long as injuries don't hamper us, it should be a good one.  GO HAWKS!!!!!<br /><br /><br />

Mar 06 2021:  <b>Overtime Thriller Ends in More Frustration</b> - <i>by CloseToAverage on September 14th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
Despite all the effort our players and coaches put in, we were defeated in overtime by Armstrong State.  We fought to the end but it just wasn't enough.  Dustin Caudill made two clutch free throws to send it in to OT, but the overall depth of Armstrong State was just too much for us.  Credit to Coach Steven McFarlane and his players.  They earned this victory.  Though I am proud of the effort they gave I feel like it was all for not with a result like this.  We can't play Derek the entire game, he's going to get hurt like that.  Next season, we're going to need our bench guys to step up.  But right now, let's enjoy the last ride of Dustin Caudill and walk-on legend Richard Spaulding.  GO HAWKS!!!!!<br /><br /><br />
