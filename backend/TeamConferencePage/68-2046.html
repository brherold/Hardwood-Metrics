Oct 07 2038:  <b>2038 Review</b> - <i>by knackles on May 4th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
The 2038 season brought one of the most successful seasons in recent years. The Broncos were dominant in conference and spent most of the year in first place. After some injuries and bad play, they fell into second place and ended the season 24-6 in conference. Although they did not win the regular season, Santa Clara was able to come back and win their tournament gaining a 6-seed in the national tournament. They won the first game but lost in the round of 32.<br />
<br />
Marlon English proved himself as one of the best players in team history placing #6 in points scored in a season (789) and graduated #12 All-Time points scored (2142). Robby Howard and Marlon English both earned all-conference honors.<br />
<br />
4 of 5 starters graduating sounds scary but Knackles believes they have the bench to have a decent season in Division V. As well as bringing in the #3 JUCO player in the country.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3726'></a>
Oct 22 2036:  <b>2036 Season Review</b> - <i>by knackles on January 18th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
2036 brought one of the worst performances from the Broncos that we have ever seen. After ending season 6-24 in conference, the streets of Santa Clara were filled with riots forcing President Knackles to go into hiding. Despite this atrocious effort, Santa Clara was somehow able to thrive and win the invitational games.<br />
<br />
When asked about future coaching, Knackles states that he is happy with Keeler and he will be the head coach for the foreseeable future. With 0 players leaving after the season 2036 will hopefully bring a better outcome with the starters having more experience. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3573'></a>
Apr 02 2035:  <b>2035 Season Review</b> - <i>by knackles on November 16th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Santa Clara entered this season with low expectations despite a greater 2034 season due to graduating most of the team and having a weak bench. Despite this, coach Keeler exceeded expectations and was able to lead the team to end 15-15 in conference as well as having 2 wins in the conference tournament and losing in the semi-finals.<br />
<br />
Owner Knackles believes that starting next season is when we should truly see the team start to flourish. Having his first recruiting class ranked 32, those freshmen improved greatly and will be entering their sophomore season as a well-trained unit. While PG Cameron Curry is the highest ranked, teams should watch out for C Brett Dubois to have a sneaky season next year.<br />
<br />
Keeler was able to have another solid recruiting class this season ranked at number 125, this includes two 3-stars and three 2-stars. Not as strong as the year prior but still some great talent to help fill the gap.<br />
<br />
With the team finally being his, we look forward to watching what they can produce and hopefully see a conference championship and promotion in the near future.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3477'></a>
Mar 23 2034:  <b>2034 Season Review</b> - <i>by knackles on September 18th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Santa Clara University had an absolutely dominant year under the hands of the new president. His first decision was to revamp the coaching staff and hire young coach Peter Keeler as the head coach. He started the year off right with a winning streak at the beginning of the season. This continued throughout, ending the season 17-13 in the conference. Not originally projected to make the tournament, the Broncos had an unbelievable postseason with two big upsets in the conference tournament ending as the 2024 conference champion. Then, as a 16 seed knocked off 1 seeded Shorter.<br />
<br />
Although some may believe this is the start of a new reign, Knackles begs to differ saying "Don't get your hopes high, we have 4 of 5 starters graduating with not very strong replacements." He believes that this will be a weak season but can follow it up with a strong future.<br />
<br />
While that may be worrying to some, the incoming freshman class looks unstoppable. With 5 total commits coming in at number 30 in the nation currently for recruiting. Hoping for 1 more late commit would set this team up for success in the long run.<br /><br /><br />

Mar 05 2033:  <b>New President Brings Hope to University</b> - <i>by knackles on July 17th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
A new President means new goals and a new life brought to the program. Knackles joins Santa Clara with a wealth of knowledge and ambitious sights for the university. With hopes of putting this team back on track to compete nationally.<br /><br /><br />
