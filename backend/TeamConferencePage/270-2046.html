Jan 26 2008:  <b>4 star player from China commits to Texus Southern tigers.</b> - <i>by ianmcnamara on September 7th, 2019</i> <br /><br />
Great news came out of texus southern tigers today, Young China international prospect Xiaojian Yeung committed his future to Texus southern tigers. The 6ft 3 inch Point gard has committed to the college and we're looking forward to having him at the college next season. He's tipped to be a very good all round player so if he develops correctly he's lightly to get a huge amount of game time. The presedent said the following.<br />
<br />
"We are pleased to have another prospect and it's fantastic that our presedent and coach are working hard to make sure we can get new players for next season. the players we're looking at are all in the 3 to five star bracket of potential and that's what we're aiming for. Our aim is to make sure as many players can make it as possible. We're looking forward to our ne lad coming from China for next season and we hope he'll not regret committing to us and will have a fantastic chance of making professional basket ball his career."<br /><br /><br />

Jan 24 2008:  <b>Kirk Gaddis commits to Texas Southern tigers.</b> - <i>by ianmcnamara on September 5th, 2019</i> <br /><br />
Kirk Gaddis 17 year old seniour has now pledged his future to Texus suthern as his college. He's a small forward who will have to fight hard to get into the side, thankfully age will be on his side, we're working on other prospects but Kerk is our first. The presedant had the following to say.<br />
<br />
"It's great to land our first prospect, Kerk looks like a decent player but if he wants to make it to the pros he's going to have to show his abilities and improve his potential, we'll work hard to develop him but he's got to be willing to fight for game time, the small forward position at our club is very competitive with some taller players than him in the running, he's a player who is going to have to really show us massive improvement. We have two other players who we are currently in contact with but as of yet we're not sure weather either of them will come."<br /><br /><br />
