Feb 28 2032:  <b>ECSU clinches first conference title in program history</b> - <i>by kauffdaddy on May 20th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
WILLIMANTIC, Conn. -- From doormats to champions.<br />
Eastern Connecticut State, for so long college basketball's worst program, has flipped the script in 2032, and now the Warriors are VI.26 Conference champions.<br />
Thursday's 81-60 victory over Hollins in the final home game of the season -- in front of 1,718 elated fans -- guaranteed ECSU will finish first thanks to an unbeatable point differential.<br />
"It's been an incredible season for us as a team, for the fans and for this university," said head coach Darius Knight. "We are thrilled to be promoting to Division 2, and we believe the best is yet to come."<br /><br /><br />

Jan 15 2032:  <b>ECSU thrills largest crowd in years with latest victory</b> - <i>by kauffdaddy on May 7th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
WILLIMANTIC, Conn. -- Eastern Connecticut State sent its largest home crowd in years home happy with a thrilling 78-76 victory over Tiffin that kept the Warriors alone in first place in the VI.26 Conference at the midway point.<br />
ECSU is 13-2 in conference play and 16-9 overall, the Warriors' most wins in a season since going 16-25 in 2018. Their last winning record came in 2016, when they finished 23-19.<br />
The win over Tiffin came in front of 1,147 fans, ECSU's first time drawing more than 1,000 fans since drawing 1,122 fans in a blowout loss to Randolph in 2020.<br />
The Warriors rank 39th in RPI in Division III and are projected as a No. 8 seed in the national tournament.<br /><br /><br />

Oct 03 2030:  <b>ECSU President: Warriors will have winning season, be in Division 1 by 2035</b> - <i>by kauffdaddy on February 12th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Eastern Connecticut State president of men's basketball operations Daniel Kauffman created a stir with less than a week before the start of the regular season, saying he believes the Warriors will have a winning record this year and will promote to Division 1 by the start of the 2034-35 season.<br />
<br />
Kauffman's statements were met with surprise by many and laughter from some -- understandable given ECSU's woeful history. The Warriors have finished 3-38 each of the last two seasons, have not won more than 12 games in a season since going 16-25 in 2018, and have never played in Division 1, with only two seasons in Division 2.<br />
<br />
However, ECSU landed seven recruits last year and that recruiting class was ranked No. 41 nationally, including all teams from Division 1 through Division 3. The Warriors also landed four recruits in the 2029 class -- their first recruiting commitments in more than a decade.<br /><br /><br />

Dec 29 2029:  <b>Sports Magazine names Eastern Connecticut State the worst college basketball program in the nation</b> - <i>by kauffdaddy on January 12th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Sports Magazine "awarded" Eastern Connecticut State the title of "Worst College Basketball Program in the United States" in its most recent weekly edition.<br />
<br />
"This might be the first title of any significance Eastern Connecticut State has ever won," said the article. "The Warriors earned it honestly."<br />
<br />
ECSU has been in Division 3 for all but two years of its history, and instantly demoted back to Division 3 each time, in 2002 and 2009.<br />
<br />
The Warriors' last winning season was a 23-19 campaign in 2016. ECSU won 16 games in 2017, won 12 times in 2018, and have not won more than 11 games in a season since.<br />
<br />
The Warriors finished 1-40 in both 2025 and 2026, went 3-38 in 2020, 2022 and 2029, and are 1-21 so far in 2030.<br />
<br />
Since the start of the 2020 season, ECSU is 52-381. The Warriors' all-time record is 372-873.<br />
<br />
Also considered for the "award" were:<br />
<br />
Wheelock -- Has never competed outside of Division 3, with a best conference finish of fourth, no conference tournament championship game appearances and no national tournament invites. They are 446-800 all-time.<br />
<br />
Pittsburg State -- Promoted out of Division 3 once, in 2003, and promptly demoted the nest year. Had a stretch from 2015 to 2019 in which they went 28-177. They are 444-801 all-time.<br />
<br />
Randolph -- A strong contender from 2001 until 2018, the WildCats have been significantly better since 2019, promoting to Division 2 and staying there for seven seasons while winning 20-plus games eight straight years. They are 489-760 all-time.<br />
<br />
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute -- Promoted out of Division 3 once, finishing second in its conference in 2022, and promptly demoted the next season. They are 499-746 all-time.<br /><br /><br />
