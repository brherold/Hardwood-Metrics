Oct 08 2015:  <b>FAREWELL COACH!</b> - <i>by Redseas on October 23rd, 2020</i> <br /><br />
15 YEARS! That is all you need to know about this man! A Great Man! A Legend around Campus! After 15 years of servicing the men's basketball program, Ismael Hidalgo finally decided it was time to call it quit. People will mostly remember him for his dedication to the program through all the Ups and Down. He never gave up he kept pushing and made his name an household name. He was able to coach many talent over the year while last year teams wasnt his most talented, for him it was a special experience to guide them to the final 4 as a #7 seed, going 67-24 under the new regime is something he has got to be proud of, With a career win avg of .652 he was a true winner. We Wish him well in all his future endeavors!<br />
<br />
Thank You For All The Memories!<br /><br /><br />

Mar 28 2015:  <b>Final Four Looming</b> - <i>by Redseas on October 21st, 2020</i> <br /><br />
Walking around campus this morning, you can feel the excitement and the joy of the fans every corner you turn you will see someone wearing a jersey or someone else yelling go Tigers. NO ONE expected them to be there but they had the expectation on themselves and they made it this far despite all the adversities faces. Fans from all over the country, alumni have come to campus to fill out the Spanos Center to support their team! Regardless of the result to day you have sense that everyone consider these Tigers to be Heros and there will be a big argument to include them in the half of fame for this feat, not many teams get to be in the final four, coming from behind a few time to get it done is what makes this team special, they never quit, they wont quit and even today they will give their all to make everyone proud! GO TIGERS!!!!<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1074'></a>
Mar 28 2015:  <b>FINAL FOUR!!!!!!!!!!</b> - <i>by Redseas on October 20th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
2nd season in charge with this new regime and after a sweet 16 birth last season! This team managed to get over the hump and reached the FINAL FOUR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PROGRAM HISTORY!!!!<br />
<br />
Im so very proud of what we had accomplished with a weaker team than last year, but we showed heart and determination all season long!<br />
<br />
Lead by junior guard Schaffer and Star senior PF Stiles, the team never looked like they were going to lose the game. Every thing Southern Indiana through there way they had an answer and managed to pull away to secure the comfortable win!<br />
<br />
Sophomore President Redseas is really pleased with this accomplishment and would like to thank anyone who gave me advice along the way to get me to where i am today! Special Shoutout to Blackbeard!<br />
<br />
Facing a familiar foe in Huntington against whom we split games with last season, Star PG and player of the game Kevin Gibson knows it is going to be a tough battle but we want all the smoke. "We embrace being the underdog but we are coming in and ready to leave it all on the court to make the fans happy."<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_880'></a>
Jan 18 2014:  <b>First Recruit Ever</b> - <i>by Redseas on August 5th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
It is with great pleasure that we are announcing that Russ Marino the #70 prospect in the country chose to commit with the Tigers for the upcoming season.<br />
<br />
Since taking charge at the beginning of the season, multiple visits were made with the highly sought prospect. Russ Marino decided staying closer to home would've been more beneficial he also mentioned that to have the opportunity to play for the current #2 team in the country is an opportunity he couldn't let slip away. He said he'll be ready to play wherever coach needs him, he also talked about how Kevin Gibson why he committed at the University of the Pacific.<br />
<br />
Around campus and around the world, there is a sense of excitement among Tigers fan. They are still hoping to get a commitment of their #1 target. Even if there were to miss out, Marino give them more option to be flexible to look or potential prospect that could help in the future.<br />
<br />
In other news, we bounced back from a surprise lost to Seton Hall, the race to the #1 seed in the conference is far from over but the Tigers still have a 3 game lead.<br />
<br />
Next game: Away at <b>Lewis &amp; Clark</b><br /><br /><br />

Dec 12 2013:  <b>#1 Team in the country!</b> - <i>by Redseas on July 26th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
Tigers fans all around the country are all excited after the release of the new Top-25 Poll where their team was slotted in the top spot for the first time this season. New president Redseas didn't want to take any of the credit instead he wanted to point out how this group of player and coaching staff were all the reason why this feat was possible. "We have a resilient group" he said. The road will only get tougher from here on out with 3 upcoming games against 3 ranked team. Regardless of the outcome, the Tigers remains the only undefeated team in conference I and II. More people are falling in love with them and sales in merchandise went up 178%.<br />
<br />
<b>Next Up</b> At Home vs #21 Evansville<br /><br /><br />
