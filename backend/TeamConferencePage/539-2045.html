Feb 06 2025:  <b>The Winning Streak</b> - <i>by waffleman17 on April 18th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
<b>-New Haven Chargers Daily-</b><br />
<br />
The New Haven Chargers had a president turnover just last offseason. New president waffleman17 was deemed with the hard task of building this program, a program in fact that has not won a single conference championship. waffleman17 in an interview said, "I'm looking to make fundemental changes to they we approach building this program and that starts with the culture in the building."<br />
<br />
The season had started off tough, as in non-conference play, the Chargers had to face 5 D1 programs while still struggling as a D3 program. They esacped with a 1-4 record. The Chargers ended non-conference games 1-9, with 7 of them being road games.<br />
<br />
The beginning of the season continued loooking bleak with no consistent play or lineups. Then to follow that up with a 0-3 start in conference play and a devestating OT loss to Wayne State College. Chargers were now sitting at 1-12(<i>0-3</i>) for the season with no momentum.The Chargers would finally catch a break in their next game at Angelo State and pick up their first conference win, 75-61. With Parker leading the way scoring 17 pts and 5 rebs. Then over the next 9 games the Chargers would go 5-4, ending with a loss at Utah Valley, 70-92.<br />
<br />
The team entered Jan 4th with a record of 7-16(<i>6-7</i>) and were taking on Emporia State twice (<i>I know there was glitch but still counted on record</i>) because of the snow storm in the North East. Little did they know this would spark an historic run.<br />
<br />
The date is now Feb 6th and the Chargers have now won 11 games in a row! Their longest winstreak since 2009 and most conference games won since 2012. Chargers defeated the Merrimack Warriors, 80-62 with a big proformance from SR-Chad Simmions(PF), who dropped 27 pts. The New Haven Chargers are now 18-16 (<i>17-7</i>).<br />
<br />
Next game might be the toughest challegne yet. Chargers play (<i>1st</i>)LIU-Brooklyn at home, and will have to be without JR-Scotty Parker(SF)-<i>14.1 pts, 5.8 rebs, 1.2 stls</i>-, who will miss the next 5 games.<br />
