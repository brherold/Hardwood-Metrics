Dec 02 2023:  <b>First Conference Play loss suffered, but recruiting class completed</b> - <i>by stevo on February 2nd, 2022</i> <br /><br />
The Redhawks fell to MIT 94-96 in overtime after opening up conference play in their division 1 return with three straight wins.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the commitment of West Virginian power forward Kendrick Barnes - for whom they had competed with conference rivals West Virginia - rounds out Southeast Missouri's recruiting class pretty early on in the season. Barnes (3*) joins fellow power forward Gorman Nelson (2*) and shooting guard Scott Wooten (3*).<br /><br /><br />

Oct 05 2023:  <b>D1 Promotion!</b> - <i>by stevo on January 17th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
In a surprising turn of events, the Southeast Missouri Redhawks have been promoted to the Division 1's IV.3 conference following the conclusion of the 2022/2023 season! The promotion caught the Athletic Department by surprise and marks the end of an eight-year-drought which the Redhawks spent in the lower division's conferences. In 2015, they last played Division 1 basketball.<br />
With their standout seniors Barry Morrow and Miles Gilbert having graduated, the promotion will provide the Redhawks with a tough challenge nonetheless.<br />
<br />
In other news, Barry Morrow set a new single season record for assists with a total of 305 dimes and an average of 6.9 assists per game.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_2090'></a>
Mar 24 2022:  <b>Southeast Missouri finishes season with positive record</b> - <i>by stevo on November 15th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
After the first full season under the new reigns, the Redhawks are happy for a couple of reasons: First, they finished the season on a high note - with a positive overall record, some playoff heroics by senior Joel Steiner and two wins in a row to close out the season. Second and most importantly, they narrowly avoided relegation on the last of the conference's regular season.<br />
<br />
It didn't look like the latter would be possible after the departure of last season's upperclassmen but a 6-4 run during the conference's last 10 and a 79-67 win over Rutgers in the last game made the impossible possible.<br />
<br />
Senior Joel Steiner made headlines when he sank a half court heave as time expired in the opening game of the conference playoffs, giving the Redhawks a 95-93 win over Salem International.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Team awards</u></b><br />

<a id='releases_2063'></a>
Feb 19 2022:  <b>Matthias Jäger joins Redhawks as first commit</b> - <i>by stevo on November 5th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The new Southeast Missouri management is happy to end the self-imposed ban on press releases with the announcement that 3 star recruit Matthias Jäger will be joining the Redhawks next season. Jäger is a 5'11 small forward from Austria, touted as the #15 international prospect of this class, that can help the team out at several positions. Joining Cameron Bassett as the second international of the team, Jäger possesses a standout, lightning-quick speed and projects to be a solid all around scorer. He currently averages 13.7 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 3.0 assists in Austria.<br />
<br />
Edit: Jonathan Rasmussen, an Alabama native, has agreed to follow suit and thus rounds out this year's recruiting class for Southeast Missouri. Rasmussen is comfortable playing both at point guard and small forward and has a complete contrary player profile than Matthias Jäger. Not much of a scorer in any regard, the three star prospect has all the tools to become a defensive stalwart during his college career. <br /><br /><br />

Nov 13 2021:  <b>Southeast Missouri add dazzling wins to their record</b> - <i>by stevo on October 8th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The Redhawks have started their season on a high note, with the upperclassmen like Miles Gilbert and Joel Steiner leading the way for the team. The newest wins over Miami-Ohio and Ball State just add to that impression, and put Southeast Missouri's record now at 6-2 ahead of today's home matchup against Hamline.<br />
<br />
Both of those last games were noteworthy - in a game where two teams named Redhawks faced off at Millett Hall, Southeast Missouri put Miami-Ohio six feet under as they routed them with a whopping 85-34. Joel Steiner paced all players with a season high of 31 points (including six treys), adding 7 assists and steals apiece for an outstanding performance. Barry Morrow starred in his second start of the season as Steiner's backcourt partner, adding 18 points and 5 steals. The team was able to hold Miami-Ohio to 11 points in the first half, then continued to play in the second half with the same vengeance and forced 31 turnovers over the course of the evening.<br />
<br />
A day later at Show Me Center, the Redhawks welcomed Division I team Ball State on their home turf. After a close contest throughout the first half, Southeast Missouri pulled away in the second half to win the game 92-82. Led by their big men Ryan Fogle (13 points, 11 rebounds) and Miles Gilbert (23 points, 10 rebounds, 11-14 FG), the team managed to overcome Joel Steiner's foul trouble. Apart from winning the rebounding battle, the Redhawks also went to the line a lot and capitalized on those attempts to gain an edge.<br /><br /><br />
