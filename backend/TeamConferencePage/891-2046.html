Oct 16 2019:  <b>Is this team legit!?</b> - <i>by BashioTheMustachio on June 10th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
Shortly after firing Rob Hemphill, Plymouth State decided to take a flyer on a much younger coach. Enters Coach George Farley with 6 years of AC under his belt. Many things were uncertain whether the team would mesh well and stay afloat in d1 basketball but judging from the first game, Coach Farley seemed so silence a lot of critics. “ Are game plan was to come in and play fundamental basketball down to the tee” said coach Farley as he whisked away with a 94-75 win over a MSU Moorhead team many thought would walk all over the Panthers!<br />
Leading the surge was POTG Robbie Clawson scoring 15 points 7 rebounds and 4 assist. “I rave about this young man but what really impressed me was his defense” says Coach Farley before exiting the podium. A tough game awaits the Panthers as they travel to ranked opponent Clark in hopes of another upset. This is Duke Ruse checking out.<br /><br /><br />

Mar 07 2013:  <b>Newfound Courage!</b> - <i>by BashioTheMustachio on June 23rd, 2020</i> <br /><br />
This has been a roller coaster season of disaster with a hint of hope. Finishing 10-30 for the season seems like a unlikely rehire of Coach Hemphil, but he has managed to reel in some talent. Coach Hemphil has recruited National Rank #116 Buck Fitzgerald who seems to be one of the finer signings following Wilkerson and Pitts. With the addition of these talented players I expect to see a more competitive team in years to come. One thing I have noticed is the sudden rise of Neil McKinnon. Putting up a more complete performance in the later half of the season. <br /><br /><br />

Dec 08 2011:  <b>Thru the turmoil!</b> - <i>by BashioTheMustachio on April 2nd, 2020</i> <br /><br />
Tho this season has looked nothing less than a dumpster fire, one bright spot has shown its way thru the darkness. Three star recruit SF Neil McKinnon committed to Plymouth State today. “Showing his prowess in scoring and winning made him worth the time invested” said Coach Hemphill. McKinnon sat down to say” the moment I got the call from Coach and he told me what he wanted from me, I was sold”. Maybe this season may be a wash but the future looks bright!<br /><br /><br />

Nov 09 2011:  <b>All Hail Leggett!</b> - <i>by BashioTheMustachio on March 25th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
Following the recent hiring of Rob Hemphill barring a 0-6 record from previous regime secured a much needed home victory from the visiting team. All eyes was on how this newbie coach with no experience was going to steer this lifeless team. “To our surprise, they came in with a fire lit under their belly and scored decisively” said one reporter. Post game interview with new coach Rob Hemphill and starting PG Leggett explain how he felt comfortable in the offense being ran going a stellar 9-12 in FG and 2-2 in 3pt. “This is only the beginning” says Leggett as he descends from the table to head back to the locker room. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_592'></a>
Nov 05 2011:  <b>Under New Management!</b> - <i>by BashioTheMustachio on March 25th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
Upon further consideration we decided to part ways with Steve Lawless to usher in up and coming coach Rob Hemphill. During the press conference Hemphill stated that he will bring this team back from the brink of disaster. Panther Pride!<br /><br /><br />
