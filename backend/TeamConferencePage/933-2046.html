Feb 01 2018:  <b>Edgewood Eagles Replace Coach</b> - <i>by desdope on March 20th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
Today, 62 year-old coach Ryan Knudsen was replaced by the young and unproven Martin Pickard. An unnamed source claimed Edgewood's management was unhappy about the failed campaign that sees the Eagles fighting against relegation to Div VI.<br />
<br />
Another point of conflict revolved around coach Knudsen's recruitment efforts. If rumours are to be believed, his focus on individual talent over team coherence and roster depth was not well received by the new president of the program - and as we know, coach Knudsen was not the type to let others interfere.<br />
<br />
An official spokesman said, "We wish coach Knudsen the best for his future and we are very grateful for all his work in these past years. He managed to bring the Eagles back to Div V. However, after this slow start we are fighting relegation and needed a change. Also, regardless of whether we manage to stay in Div V after this season, we wanted to bring someone on board who has a long-term vision and coach Pickard seems is a perfect fit, despite his young age and inexperience. We don't look for quick fixes, we want to lay a sound base and build from there."<br />
<br />
We asked coach Knudsen for comment, which he declined - gracefully as ever - by spitting on the floor, lighting a cigar and staring at our reporter for a couple of minutes before shuffling of when the smoke detectors finally reacted and the sprinklers went into action.<br /><br /><br />

Apr 04 2011:  <b>Conference Awards Announced</b> - <i>by epicsaxguy42 on March 13th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
After the conclusion of the tournaments, conference awards were announced. After 4 outstanding years leading the Edgewood Eagles from the point guard position, Charles Baumann proved just how good he was, winning the Conference player of the year award. He was also named to the All-Conference team along with his teammate Victor Bolton, who made it at the power forward position.<br />
<br />
Congrats to Charles and Victor, both of whom will be greatly missed next year and will surely be named to the Edgewood Hall-of-Fame before next season. <br /><br /><br />

Mar 10 2011:  <b>Edgewood Destroys Davis & Elkins in First Conference Playoff Game</b> - <i>by epicsaxguy42 on March 4th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
In a 118-59 shellacking, the Edgewood Eagles made quick work of the Davis &amp; Elkins Senators in their first of hopefully many conference playoff games. Charles Baumann showed the fans why he is one of the clear front-runners in the race for conference MVP. He tallied 57 points along with 5 assists and 4 steals. He went 20-26 from the field, including 4-7 from beyond the arc. He also made 13-15 free throws. Edgewood looks to continue this outstanding play into their next game against the Texas Lutheran Bulldogs.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_516'></a>
Dec 18 2010:  <b>New Edgewood Point Leader</b> - <i>by epicsaxguy42 on February 9th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
With an outstanding 45 point game against Kentucky Wesleyan, Charles Baumann officially passed Edgewood Hall of Famer Curt Ott to become the all-time scoring leader of the Edgewood Eagles. Baumann's career has been a story of consistent improvement and constant growth. Each year he has averaged more points than the last, improving his field goal and free throw percentages along the way. He won the Freshman of the Year in his first year, scoring 12.7 points per game, grabbing 2 rebounds and 1.3 assists. He then made the All-Conference team at Shooting Guard, averaging 18.9 points and 2.5 rebounds. This year, however, he is having a career season scoring 24.4 points to go with 3.3 rebounds and 2.6 assists, including career games of 47 and 45 points. His current stats would make him the highest-scoring player in a single season in Edgewood history, and would put him in a good position to make the All-Conference team again and maybe even grab the elusive Conference MVP Award.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Charles. Keep up the good work and Go Eagles!<br /><br /><br />

Dec 16 2010:  <b>Baumann Closing In On Ott</b> - <i>by epicsaxguy42 on February 8th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
With an 18 point effort in the loss against Methodist University, Charles Baumann is now a mere 36 points away from tying Edgewood's all-time scoring record of 2,518 points, set by team Hall of Famer Curt Ott. When notified of this news after the game, Baumann stated that he did not know of this statistic, but he would just keep trying to lead his guys to a win every game. When asked if he believed his record could be tied or even beaten, Ott said that he knew it would and that, if he could choose, Charles Baumann would be just the person that he would want to hold the new record, and that he thinks it could even be beaten in Edgewood's upcoming game, with Baumann averaging 27 points in conference games this year, including a spectacular 47 point outing earlier in the year.<br />
<br />
Good luck Charles and Go Eagles!<br /><br /><br />
