Apr 02 2035:  <b>2035 Season Recap</b> - <i>by purple3594 on November 16th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
<b>Super Seniors</b><br />
Back-to-back sub-par recruiting classes inevitably resulted in consecutive demotions. The silver lining: those lost classes meant tons of playing time for the 2030 recruiting class. In their last two years, <a href="../../../player/154015" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Lamonte Wynn</a> and <a href="../../../player/151510" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Ike Callaway</a> advanced Ripon to S16 twice, returned it to LL2, and became program all-timers. Career ranks:<br />
<br />
Wynn:<br />
1st assists<br />
4th minutes<br />
4th steals<br />
<br />
Callaway, 3 contacts:<br />
1st minutes<br />
1st steals<br />
1st 3pm<br />
3rd points<br />
33.9 o3%<br />
39.4 3%<br />
<br />
<b>Defensive Minded</b><br />
Conference opponents registered lowest efg (48.8), scored least pitp (31.5), second least 3pm (6.7) and 3% (32.4) on ~79 possessions. <a href="../../../player/164147" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Toni Olivera</a> led the defense with a conference 42.8 oefg at c (!!).<br />
<br />
<b>Andrew Merrill Rising</b><br />
A 7-man rotation emerged with <a href="../../../player/165712" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Merrill</a> as the lead pf after 14-pot <a href="../../../player/169739" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Phil Knepper's</a> late-season injury. As a starter, Merrill was 11-1, including 6-0 in final 6 must-win regular season games to secure promotion. At 21.7 conference minutes, his Freshman of the Year award came as a pleasant surprise, but was well-earned for the cornerstone big man.<br />
<br />
<b>Spread the Floor</b><br />
Next year, who's spacing the floor? Season 3% for returning guards: <a href="../../../player/163281" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Bret Scully</a> (32.6), <a href="../../../player/163056" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Joe Powell</a> (28.7), and Knepper (17.4). Shooting will dictate the team's ceiling.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_2653'></a>
Oct 17 2026:  <b>2026 Ripon Year in Review</b> - <i>by purple3594 on July 6th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
<b>Recap:</b> In Coach <a href="../../../coach/282" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Tom Rinaldi’s</a> final season, the Red Hawks won its final regular season game to place tenth and survive relegation. Two draftees, <a href="../../../player/116732" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Scott Cranford</a> (10, Magic) and <a href="../../../player/110973" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Jimmy Sala</a> (28, Pacers), graduate having overseen the program through two promotions. The 22nd ranked four-man recruiting class hopes to keep Ripon in LL2 as new head man <a href="../../../coach/4051" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Arnie McDermott</a> starts his rebuild.<br />
<br />
<b>Overall:</b><br />
50.6 efg / 52.9 oefg<br />
<br />
<b>Superlatives:</b><br />
<br />
<i>MOP:</i> Jimmy Sala (11.7 ppg, 9.9 rpg, 1.6 bpg, 53.9 efg, 47.4 oefg)<br />
Finally a clear cut starter in the frontcourt, Sala cleaned the glass and defended his position well. With an excellent frame, efficient shot, and untapped potential, Sala played his way into the first round.<br />
<br />
<i>Rookie:</i> <a href="../../../player/124931" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Cristian Lozano</a> (9 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 1.4 bpg, 57.8 efg, 50.7 oefg)<br />
The 10 pot redshirt freshman became a mainstay in the frontcourt; he started 26 games. The 7+ footer had the best net efg on the team. He’ll battle to keep his starting spot next year.<br />
<br />
<i>Breakout (predicted):</i> <a href="../../../player/128257" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Larry Blair</a> (4.1 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 50.4 efg, 57.4 oefg)<br />
After an underwhelming freshman campaign, Blair’s enjoyed an exceptional preseason. He scored 28 and 27 points in two potg performances. With Sala off to the pros, Blair will compete with holdovers <a href="../../../player/115056" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Jordan Fontana</a> and Lozano as well as upstart freshmen for the starting job; he has the inside track right now.<br />
<br />
<b>Ahead:</b> Less Rinaldi, Cranford, and Sala, it’s a new chapter in Ripon. With the 11th best preseason conference TPI, McDermott must balance surviving relegation and developing the kids. Interesting choices ahead.<br />
<br />
<b>PB’s:</b><br />

Mar 31 2025:  <b>2025 Ripon Year in Review</b> - <i>by purple3594 on May 5th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
<b>Recap:</b> After claiming its second promotion and conference playoff title in as many years, Ripon’s most talented team capped off a remarkable season with an Elite 8 run. All-conference <a href="../../../player/116732" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Scott Cranford</a> will lead the Red Hawks in its first ever LL2 campaign.<br />
<br />
<b>Overall:</b><br />
Offense 55.8 efg%, 1.03 PPP;<br />
Defense 47.8 oefg%, 0.83 oPPP<br />
Led conference in PPP, fg% and steals<br />
<br />
<b>Superlatives:</b><br />
<br />
<i>MOP:</i> <a href="../../../player/106312" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Tyrod Hornsby</a>. Although Cranford posted outstanding numbers (19.6 ppg, 5 apg, +13 net efg), undersized center Hornsby controlled the paint on both ends scoring on 61.9 percent of his twos and only conceding 41.5 percent of those shots on defense. He tallied 14.9 ppg and 9.2 rpg to dictate the Red Hawks inside/out attack.<br />
<br />
<i>Rookie:</i> <a href="../../../player/122824" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Eddie Uchikawa</a>. The 10 pot redshirt freshman was originally characterized as “playable depth” but he eventually asserted himself as the team’s preferred starting SG. On a team starved for outside shooting, Uchikawa averaged 1.6 3PM on 35.9%. He also paced the team in steals at 2 per.<br />
<br />
<i>Recruit:</i> <a href="../../../player/128257" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Larry Blair</a>. Although one-time five star <a href="../../../player/132522" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Rhett Earl</a> hopes to find footing as the marksman this team craves, Blair gets the nod with frontcourt starters <a href="../../../player/111517" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Bill Anderson</a> and Hornsby graduating.<br />
<br />
<i>Breakout (predicted):</i> <a href="../../../player/110973" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Jimmy Sala</a>. In the S16 and E8 games, <a href="../../../player/116529" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Rodger Brandt</a> scored 22 and 21, respectively – an expanded role for Brandt raises this team’s ceiling. But, next year’s projected C Sala also delivered in an expanded role in the tourney averaging 7 rpg, 2.3 bpg, and 28% o2fg. Has <a href="../../../coach/282" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Coach Rinaldi</a> finally figured out how to use these two? They played well under pressure.<br />
<br />
<b>Ahead:</b> Backcourt continuity, frontcourt turnover. The recipe for next year’s team may need tweaking, but backcourt experience and talent should keep Ripon in contention. Next year’s starting TPI (as of Dev 15): 147.4<br />
<br />
<b>PB’s:</b><br />
Manager Ranking: 56<br />
Final Team Ranking: 15<br />
Final TPI: 157.7<br />

<b>Grade:</b> A<br />

Apr 01 2024:  <b>2024 Ripon Year in Review</b> - <i>by purple3594 on March 10th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
<b>Recap:</b> After seven years in IV.5, Ripon’s best-ever team won a pair of trophies and will return to LL3 for the first time since 2009. On the back of that strong conference showing, the Red Hawks earned its first-ever bid into the D1 tournament as a 2 seed, but it fell short in the first round against perennial power Tennessee. A strong core returns next year hungry to challenge for trophies and to advance deeper into March.<br />
<br />
<b>Overall:</b><br />
Offense 56.3 efg%, 1.04 PPP;<br />
Defense 49.2 oefg%, 0.84 oPPP<br />
Net +7.1 efg, +.2 PPP<br />
Led conference in efficiency markers (fg%, 3fg%, efg%, PPP, oPPP) and steals<br />
<br />
<b>Backcourt:</b><br />
<a href="../../../player/116732" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Scott Cranford</a>, 15.4 ppg, 3.4 apg, 1.4 spg (+9.6 net efg)<br />
<a href="../../../player/113146" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Walt Bruno</a>, 7.8 ppg, 4.8 apg, 1.5 spg (+9.5)<br />
<a href="../../../player/116529" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Rodger Brandt</a>, 8ppg, 2.6 apg, 1.1 spg (+2.2)<br />
<br />
Cranford emerged toward the end of the year, earning potg honors in all four conference tournament games. His climb has been steady; from sixth man to starting shooting guard, and he figures to be the team’s centerpiece moving forward. Beside him, Bruno steadily manned the point with strong efficiency numbers, but a lack of counting stats from the marquee position might force coach Rinaldi to push him off the ball next year. If Bruno lands at SF, Brandt will have his chance.<br />
<br />
<b>Frontcourt:</b><br />
<a href="../../../player/104386" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Paul Hodge</a>, 17.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 2 spg (+19.7!)<br />
<a href="../../../player/106312" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Tyrod Hornsby</a>, 13.1 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 1.4 spg, 1.4 bpg (+9.4)<br />
<a href="../../../player/111517" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Bill Anderson</a>, 9.6 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 1.4 spg (+5.1)<br />
<a href="../../../player/100848" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Nick Rucker</a>, 10 ppg, 4.1 rpg (+8.7)<br />
<a href="../../../player/115056" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Jordan Fontana</a>, 7.1 ppg, 4.5 rpg (+5.3)<br />
<a href="../../../player/110973" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Jimmy Sala</a>(-7.4)<br />
<br />
Hodge was a 3&amp;D ace this year. In addition to leading the conference in steals and +/-, the 2-time all-conference was top five in points, 3pm, 3p%, and potg. Historically, no Ripon player has swiped more in a year than Hodge in 2024. He rounds out his career fourth in steals and ninth in points. Fellow senior, Nick Rucker, the school’s most efficient three point shooter in history, graduates, too. Still, four post players return including Hornsby who started every game. Anderson and Fontana complement Hornsby well, and a jumbo lineup of all three could be in the cards, as well.<br />
<br />
<b>Recruiting:</b><br />
RS <a href="../../../player/122824" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Eddie Uchikawa</a>, SF, 102, 10 Pot<br />
RS <a href="../../../player/121961" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Benny Slack</a>, C, 102, 10 Pot<br />
#177 <a href="../../../player/127193" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Brett Pavone</a>, PG, 116 SI, 12 Pot<br />
<a href="../../../player/124931" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Cristian Lozano</a>, C, 97 SI, 10 Pot<br />
<br />
With Bruno’s potential swap to SF, Uchikawa becomes important playable depth, particularly at shooting guard. If his physical traits translate and his rise mimics Hodge, the Red Hawks would be thrilled. Slack and Lozano should have more time to develop; Hornsby and Anderson will be seniors next year. Point-of-the-future Pavone is poised to redshirt.<br />
<br />
<b>Ahead:</b> Hodge is a massive loss, no doubt about it, but next year’s team is <i>supposed to be</i> better. We’ll see.<br />

Apr 03 2023:  <b>2023 Ripon Year in Review</b> - <i>by purple3594 on January 13th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
<b>Preseason Expectations</b><br />
For the first time in school history, Ripon opened the year with a 140+ TPI. Still, a tough promotion battle loomed as five other IV.5 schools sat above the Red Hawks in the TPI standings.<br />
<br />
<b>Conference Result</b><br />
Projected 6th; Finished 6th.<br />
<br />
<b>Notable</b><br />
-The team topped the league in 3p% for the second straight year.<br />
-<a href="../../../player/100659" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Willie Tyler</a> led the conference in assists (7.6 apg). He graduates as the top assist man in school history (808).<br />
-All-Conference <a href="../../../player/104386" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Paul Hodge</a> ranked fifth in scoring (17.4 ppg) and third from distance (43.9 3fg%).<br />
-In addition to Tyler (41 GS), former Freshman of the Year, <a href="../../../player/105331" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Carmelo Amador</a> (40), will graduate.<br />
<br />
<b>Recruiting</b><br />
-Following its most impressive recruiting haul in program history, <a href="../../../coach/282" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Coach Tom Rinaldi</a> whiffed on his top targets. After a grueling two year battle, No. 1 <a href="../../../prospect/119241" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Gordon Watkins</a> spurned the in-state Red Hawks for national runner up Western Michigan.<br />
-Rinaldi quickly pivoted to out-of-state <a href="../../../prospect/122083" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Harvey Buchanan</a>, but it was only a short flirtation before he called it for conference foe, College of Charleston.<br />
-Top targets off the board, Ripon mined <a href="../../../prospect/121961" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Benny Slack</a> out of Illinois. He projects as a big man at the next level, but the Red Hawks certainly hope he sprouts in the next year or two to reach his potential.<br />
-New Yorker <a href="../../../prospect/122824" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Eddie Uchikawa</a> also pledged. An absolute specimen, the team aims to develop him in the mold of Hodge.<br />
-Former no. 35 <a href="../../../player/116529" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Rodger Brandt</a> and no. 491 big man <a href="../../../player/115056" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Jordan Fontana</a> look to carve roles coming off their redshirt seasons.<br />
<br />
<b>Season Grade</b><br />
The boys placed right where they were pegged: C.<br />
<br />
<b>Looking Forward</b><br />
While graduating a starting PG and C typically means a regression, there are plenty of capable players eyeing the vacated playing time. After all, next year's iteration will have the program's highest ever starting TPI.<br /><br /><br />
