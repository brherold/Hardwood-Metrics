Jan 25 2025:  <b>We stink.</b> - <i>by HeimTime21 on April 16th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
Title says it all.  I've never seen a team with less heart than this sorry group.  I have a center who wants to play PG.  A PG who can't dribble.  And a wide array of other problems.  It's a sad sad day in BVU.....<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_2166'></a>
Jan 14 2023:  <b>Can He Be Stopped? No, Matter of Fact He Won&#39;t Be!</b> - <i>by HeimTime21 on December 20th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
BVU Legend has ripped off an incredible streak of averaging 30.25 pts/game in a 4 game stretch including his career high of 38 pts against hated (but respected) rival Michigan State.  It has many people wondering if it is possible to stop him?  Some would say The Flash himself doesn't have the quickness to stop him on the perimeter.<br />
<br />
Let's see if he can continue the scoring barrage against Delaware for 3rd place in the IV.6 Conference.  <br /><br /><br />

Mar 09 2018:  <b>BVU Squad In Turmoil In Conf Tourney</b> - <i>by HeimTime21 on March 31st, 2021</i> <br /><br />
Buena Vista University's one man scoring machine, Chad Jacobs is a shocking discovery on the injury report for tomorrow.  Chad did not appear to get hurt last game which led to questions.  BVU, who had legitimate conference championship hopes have a date with Ohio Wesleyan tomorrow night.<br />
<br />
President HeimTime21 had a reported meeting with the Beaver's star player and was overheard leaving the dormitory while on the phone with what was presumed to be the head coach saying: "He said he's sitting out the rest of the conference tournament for fatigue.... Yeah, like he's tired or some crap....  I'm not sure what we can do because he's our only hope in the D3 playoffs... I get it, kids these day are soft."<br />
<br />
When Jacobs was asked about fatigue he smiled and said: "You'd be tired too carrying this squad on my back all season.  My goal isn't to win some stupid little conference tournament.  My goal is to win the D3 tournament.  I don't see anything wrong with wanting a little time off to recharge my batteries before I lead us to the promised land.  I talked to coach, he understands."<br />
<br />
When we asked coach Gray about his star player's "injury" he simply stated:  "I don't understand what he's thinking."<br />
<br />
We'll see how this all shakes down tomorrow as our BVU Beavers take on the solid squad of Ohio Wesleyan.  <br /><br /><br />

Feb 17 2018:  <b>BVU Head Coach Hank Gray In Hot Water</b> - <i>by HeimTime21 on March 25th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
Head coach Hank Gray is in hot water after last night's pivotal conference game against District of Columbia when he left the arena immediately after the game to meet the referees in the parking lot and have a loud altercation with them.  Local DC police had no comment on the matter.<br />
<br />
Hank Gray publicly apologized for his behavior after the game.  "I should not have chased down the refs in the parking lot, they were awful the whole game and I should have lost it during the game and got ejected.  Bobby Knight would be rolling over in his grave if he saw what these clowns did to me.  What they did was wrong and there should be an investigation into their fraud."<br />
<br />
Coach Gray's team had a solid performance during the game.  They took more shots than DC, they shot a higher percentage than DC, they outrebounded them by 17.  But the massive outlier were personal fouls.  BVU had 19 personal fouls which led to 29 free throws.  DC hit an incredible 83% from the line and had a very balanced scoring attack to win by 8.<br />
<br />
BVU is hoping for a rubber match against the extremely solid DC squad.  And is hoping that Jacobs can carry the team to a conference title in the coming weeks.  It should be a fun sprint to the finish.<br /><br /><br />

Dec 09 2017:  <b>The Beaver&#39;s Dam Has Burst</b> - <i>by HeimTime21 on March 5th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
Buena Vista Beaver's have a leaky dam now that star player, Chad Jacobs suffered a substantial hamstring injury and will be out for 11 days.  When asked about how this will affect the squad, coach HeimTime reiterated how BVU is a collective team.  And although 25+ pts per game cannot be replaced by one player.  He feels that guys will step up and fill that void.  As for the stats....  They suggest a different story.  Koch and Short both shooting below 30% from 3 will be asked to fill the void left by the 43.9% 3 pt shooter Jacobs.  We'll see how the bench performs over the next few games....<br /><br /><br />
