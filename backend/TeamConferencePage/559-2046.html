<h3>Press Releases:</h3>
<a id='releases_4107'></a>
Mar 31 2042:  <b>Underdogs</b> - <i>by JOWA on December 12th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Utah Tech's trailblazers have seemed to improve on their defensive side we may see even more improvement and changes in the oncoming future of this program.<br />
<br />
we hope to improve and make it to the tournament next year we strive to come in at least 3rd in conference this oncoming season and hope to even get promoted- President JOWA<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_2726'></a>
Mar 13 2027:  <b>We are a yo-yo team</b> - <i>by CJRICK02 on August 19th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
Despite being 3rd in our conference, having the 5th talented team in Division 3, and making it to the conference final, we will not be heading to the Tournament. It is very sad to see a flawed FPI system not see that we lost in non-conference to many D2 and higher teams that will most surely be apart of their division's tournaments, but I guess that is how the system works nowadays. Despite that, Utah Tech will be going back up to League Level 5 next season.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_2639'></a>
Apr 06 2026:  <b>End of an Era</b> - <i>by CJRICK02 on June 30th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
Officially on July  1st, 2022, Dixie State will be renamed to Utah Tech University. We had a ton of great memories as DSU, but are excited to see the memories we will make as UTU!<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1913'></a>
Oct 01 2020:  <b>Season Preview 2020-21</b> - <i>by CJRICK02 on August 1st, 2021</i> <br /><br />
After a second straight season of finsihing 10th in Conference V.2, Dixie State has found itself consistently doing enough to stay in Division 2, however President Ricks knows that this team can make more noise with its current roster. After 6 amazing seasons with Dixie State, coach Diego De La Torre officially announced his retirement this off-season. During his time as the coach of the Trailblazers, his overall record was 136-117, while having a 104-76 record in conference games. He will be replaced by 2-time National Champion Gene Barbour. Coach Barbour, who is from Coral Gables, Florida, has a record of 499-367 all-time and 2 titles in his 20-year tenure as the coach of Cal State East Bay.<br />
<br />
"I'm excited to coach this team. I helped East Bay from Division 3 to the very top of Division 1. I expect to do something simular here in St. George," Coach Barbour said in his introductionary press conference. He also announced that Angel Lopez (SR - Chula Vista, CA), Carey Kirk (SO - Aspen, CO), and Russel Dawson (SR - West Valley City, UT) were going to be the teams captians for the season.<br />
<br />
President Ricks also announced that Todd Strom will also be entering the DSU Hall of Fame this season. He will be introduced on October 21st, 2020 in the season opener against Moravian.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1795'></a>
Oct 03 2019:  <b>New Season Upcoming</b> - <i>by CJRICK02 on June 5th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
When you look at how Dixie State finished their season just under six months ago, Diego De La Torre knew that he was fortunate to have Dixie State stay in Division 2.<br />
<br />
"We had a really rough stretch to begin the season," Coach De La Torre said. "We were lucky to be able to turn the season around and finish above the relegation line."<br />
<br />
De La Torre, who will be coaching his sixth season at Dixie State this season, notes that his coaching career is coming closer to the end, and that he would like to have this team reach Division 1 again before he retires.<br />
<br />
"When I look at this team, I don't see much in terms of difference ouside of our new captain and we are going to play the same style of play from last season."<br />
<br />
It also is the first year of the annual St. George Invitational, where 11 teams will compete for glory and honor, while also getting games against quality opponents. On top of that, DSU great Aaron Blackburn will be introduced to the DSU Hall of Fame this upcoming season, on a day to be determined.<br />
<br />
Your captain this year are Jon Ivy (163, SR: Sandy, UT), Jacob Miles (146, SR: Wheat Ridge, CO), and for the first time a third captain, Chandler Carlisle (139, SR: Duluth, MN). It's the first time a player from Minnesota will be a captain for the St. George, UT side.<br /><br /><br />
