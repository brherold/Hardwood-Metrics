Mar 31 2040:  <b>Unexpected Invitational Run</b> - <i>by LaurensDeGraff on August 21st, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Our purpose was to feature redshirting freshmen Frank Talley and Louie Weber, as well as redshirt freshman Jeffery Michaels, whose playing time was relatively low as Major Moss took the helm in a struggling season. Moss manned shooting guard with top player Bert Young in the post. At first it started typically, we dropped the first game to Virginia Union 72-77, a comeback win vs. Lake Superior State with Michaels and Moss scoring 37 points started things up. They scored 53 in our next win against Buena Vista with Young chipping in 15, for 68 of our 80 points. We blew open the game against SUNYO with a big second half, with Weber scoring 12. Finally against the Lords it was Talley's turn with 18 points. In all, Michaels earned 2 POTG, Moss and Young 1. A very nice balance between all of them. It was not an overwhelming offense by any means, but through 5 games we limited opponents to an average of 72 points. Makes me very optimistic for the future, which is badly needed after 3 state demoting seasons.<br /><br /><br />

Apr 06 2037:  <b>Privateers reach Legends</b> - <i>by LaurensDeGraff on March 7th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Can't say enough about the fight in my guys. No one was all conference yet we won 32 games and reached the Sweet Sixteen of the Tournament. While it may be more than we can handle with mainstays such as Rains, Lentz, Casillas and Blocker leaving, we can at this moment bask in our accomplishment of 9 straight seasons with 25+ wins, 7 of them 30+, 7 tournament appearances, four conference tournament trophies along the way. Just one losing season in my tenure dating back to 2026. Its been quite a ride.<br /><br /><br />

Oct 16 2036:  <b>C C Blank Appreciation Day</b> - <i>by LaurensDeGraff on January 16th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
The first major NBA draftee in our history at overall #6 despite never being an AC performer. We were on him early, and he only garnered other interest when he was a Senior. Early on he showed his versatility playing his entire RS FR season as a shooting guard. With the emergence of others, he moved to PF and for someone who had the expectation of playing poor defense he allowed 46% or less OFG for 3 of his 4 seasons. He scored, rebounded, shot FT very well for a wide, tall mammal and blasted all the other skills. Best of Luck with the Bucks!<br /><br /><br />

Mar 09 2036:  <b>So proud of my team</b> - <i>by LaurensDeGraff on January 5th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
My starters missed a total of 24 games this season and the team 30 overall, yet we are promoting and won our second consecutive conference tournament. Especially impressed with the "second" team. Workman, Driver and Mabry have pretty modest SI, but have really come through when needed to come in, with minutes every healthy game and 26 games started. Its been very difficult recruiting lately, but the guys I have are exploding with talent. This will be the 6th tourney in my ten seasons, and we are likely to get our best seeding since 2014. Helps to have one of the games best head coaches, who is still only 36.<br /><br /><br />

Mar 11 2035:  <b>Lentz and Casillas come through in the clutch</b> - <i>by LaurensDeGraff on November 10th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Many fans had given us up for dead, with star PG Rains injured during a squeaky 89-85 win against UMPI in the opener of the conference tournament. Instead of turning to veteran PG Maldonado, SG Lentz took on the role, with Casillas taking his spot at SG. He put the ball on the floor 6 times during an 85-84 win against #25 Iona but scored 26 (Casillas contributing 20). This was quite a new look for us, as Iona had beaten us by 23 and 16 earlier in the season. St. Leo had beaten us by 20+ in our two matches but this time we won by 17 as this time Lentz pulled down 11 rebounds, something never done by one of our guards before to my knowledge, and while the trio was just 5-12 shooting they dished out 14 assists to post combo Blank/Gibbons and Lentz did a bit better on turnovers, with 4. Finally, the Pirates, who owned the only conference win against 41 game winner conference champion Fresno Pacific, did it again, winning by 16 to take the tourney title (our 2nd). Casillas had a much better game than Lentz with 19 but the story here was our bigs with 63 points. Maldonado got in on the action in this one with 8 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists. Going in to the tournament we were a lackluster #6 on the bubble to make it and we punched our own ticket!<br /><br /><br />
