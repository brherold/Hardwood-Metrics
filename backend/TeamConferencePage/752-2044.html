Dec 06 2042:  <b>Recognizing Hulsey</b> - <i>by BMacG on January 1st, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Former HC Dillon Hulsey was added alongside former player Dan Christy to the RIT Hall of Fame - Hulsey retired after two rough seasons, but the players he recruited will serve as the foundation of RITs coming success - he leaves as the winningest coach in RIT history, and the only coach to get them beyond LL5.<br />
<br />
Games 428, Total Wins 242, Conference Wins 167, Playoff Wins 11, Tournament Wins 4, Winning Percentage .565<br /><br /><br />

Mar 08 2041:  <b>Honoring King Christy</b> - <i>by BMacG on October 9th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
RIT held an event to honor arguably their best ever player, Dan Christy<br />
<br />
Played PF and C, and started 100% of his 162 career games.<br />
125-52 RIT record during career.<br />

Jan 24 2041:  <b>Double Double King</b> - <i>by BMacG on September 26th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Despite a mostly lost season for RIT plagued by injuries to the few veteran players on the team, SR Dan Christy has been a bright spot.<br />
<br />
With todays 22 points and 15 rebounds, Dan Christy earned his 12th "double-double" of the season, and the 55th of his career, and is (likely) the RIT record holder.<br />
<br />
Additionally, RS SR Dylan Urban now holds the RIT record for career assists with 890.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4003'></a>
Mar 24 2040:  <b>End of an Era</b> - <i>by BMacG on August 20th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
As the season comes to a close, RIT ends an era with the graduation of 3 starters and 5 scholarship seniors total. This core of players and coach Hulsey led RIT to a run of success unprecedented in the schools history.<br />
<br />
Hulsey over the last three seasons has done the following:<br />
112-24 record overall<br />
78-12 Conference record<br />
11-5 Post-season record<br />
3 Consecutive Conference Titles<br />
3 Consecutive Promotions<br />
3 NT invites<br />
<br />
The three starters graduating also made RIT history:<br />
Jacob Burns ends his career with 1854 points, 1051 rebounds, 223 steals (6th AT for RIT), and 89 blocks<br />
#1 AT for single season 3pt % (47.9)<br />
#1 AT for career 3pt% (42.1)<br />
#2 AT for career 3pt (336)<br />
#3 AT for career +/- per game (+11.69)<br />
#1 AT for career total +/- (+2081)<br />
#7 AT for POTG awards (21)<br />
<br />
Joel Shepherd was never a huge scorer, but was one of the most reliable defenders on the roster.<br />
He ends his career #2 AT for steals with 266, and he did not have any full seasons where he allowed 40% or more for OFG%.<br />
His last season his OFG allowed was 34.8% with an OeFG of 43.1%, and a career avg of 37.6/46.9, and is #3 AT for career +/- with +1781.<br />
<br />
Keith Brennan was a reliable inside scoring presence as the first seven footer in Hulseys tenure - he ends his career #1 AT for single season FG% (2038, 66%) and career FG% (62.3%).<br />
<br />
Next season will be a rebuilding season for RIT, but Dan Christy and Dylan Urban hope to be able to help RIT survive and avoid demotion in their first ever season in LL3.<br />

Nov 26 2039:  <b>Hulsey Hits Double Hundo</b> - <i>by BMacG on July 15th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Dillon Hulsey continues to build upon his legendary status at RIT - less than three seasons after becoming the winningest basketball coach in RIT history, he has hit 200 career wins as a head coach with RIT, for a career record of 200-115 (0.635) with an in-conference record of 136-76 (0.642). Additionally, he has a 10-6 Conference Tournament record, and a 4-3 National Tournament Record. He has led the team to three Conference Championships (VI.16 2035, VI.15 2038, V.8 2039) and a Conference Tournament Championship in 2038.<br />
<br />
Hulsey is RIT's first coach in school history to:<br />
- Hit 150 and 200 wins<br />
- Win back to back conference championships<br />
- Win a conference tournament championship<br />
- Win a DII conference<br />
- Promote to LL4/DI<br />
<br />
RIT is Hulsey's first shot at being a Head Coach, and he has made the most of it, totally turning around the RIT basketball program, and has been on fire over the last few seasons - over the last 100 games, the Tigers have gone 84-16.<br />
<br />
With age creeping up on him, Hulsey has hinted this may be his last season coaching - if so, what an incredible impact he has had in Rochester!<br /><br /><br />
