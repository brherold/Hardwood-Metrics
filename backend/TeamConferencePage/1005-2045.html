Mar 12 2043:  <b>Mitchell Looks from the Outside</b> - <i>by Rradley903 on January 28th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Head coach Jeremy Rowe sits alone in his office, constantly refreshing the 'Tournament' tab. "What a perverted joke," he muttered looking at <b>28-13 Arkansas State</b> and <b>Projected 6th seed 28-13 Missouri St. Louis</b> being comfortably off the bubble. The 31-10 Mitchell Mariners finished 2nd in the conference, while 1st place Principia is also on the verge of being on the bubble. "This tournament is an absolute sham if our league doesn't have atleast 4 bids. It is sick and downright malpractice should any of our promoting teams be left out of the tournament. Disgraceful." Jeremy then began pouring up mud to down his sorrows.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4037'></a>
Feb 28 2041:  <b>Mitchell Lands a Meteor</b> - <i>by Rradley903 on October 7th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Head coach Jeremy Rowe watched on as Mitchell upset the #15 Baylor Bears, chuckling to himself as the clock ticked to 0. Billy Joe Hager had 27 points and 8 rebounds and received PotG honors with Willie Bishop tacking on 10 more assists to his record setting season.<br />
<br />
The Mariners were now 10-17 in conference, a disappointing season, but to be expected after losing Tony Samuel and several vets the previous season of a #3 seed team. However, a different kind of aura filled the room after the game.<br />
<br />
No one cared that we had won, we cared about the news out of West Manchester high school in Manchester, Connecticut. Kip Butler had made his decision to commit to Mariners.<br />
<br />
Big Hardwood, your days are numbered.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4016'></a>
Oct 17 2040:  <b>Mitchell Press Conference - Immediate Release: Head Coach Dobson to step down</b> - <i>by Rradley903 on August 29th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Head coach Garry Dobson has moved on from the Mariners at the ripe age of 67. He will be replaced by young, handsome, strong, intelligent, and classy Jeremy Rowe to lead the Mariners into a new age.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4001'></a>
Mar 15 2040:  <b>Mitchell Moves On</b> - <i>by Rradley903 on August 17th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
No Tony Samuel, down at halftime, and playing a walk on shooting guard.<br />
<br />
The deck was stacked against the Mariners. Following a massive thump by the UNC-Charlotte 49ers, the Mariners faced a 26-17 Murray State as a 3-14 match up. The Racers were a team that did not deserve to get into the tourney with their record, but their roster was juiced to the gills nonetheless.<br />
<br />
92 SI SG Kwamie Cottrell had a mission. 7-13 from the field and 2 O-Rebounds gave way to a 23-minute performance for the ages. Capped by game icing free throws, Cottrell will be remembered by true Mariner fans. Mitchell will face Jackson State in the R of 32.<br />
<br />
In other news; Kip Butler, if you see this, just know the Mariners win tournament games unlike another school in the Northeast who is ranked 2nd in the nation.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3998'></a>
Mar 10 2040:  <b>Mariner Madness 2</b> - <i>by Rradley903 on August 15th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
"Now the season starts," stated Coach Dobson after watching superstar Tony Samuel and his 16.9 ppg and 2.4 spg tweak his hamstring in the last game of the season. The Mariners would cruise to win the game by double-digits over the lowly Martin Luther squad. Solidly in the tournament and having secured 2nd in the conference after not getting swept by any team and sweeping the 1st place UNC-Charlotte 49ers, the Mariners find themselves in the conference title game.<br />
<br />
"3 peat?" asked Willie Bishop and his leading 7.8 assists per game. The Mariners watched as the 49ers defeated the SDSU Aztecs. Mitchell finds itself in the conference championship game for the 2nd time under Dobson. "Things will be different this time," stated Dobson. "We have their girlfriends held hostage." Mitchell looks to win its 3rd conference tournament championship in history tomorrow.<br /><br /><br />
