Mar 05 2026:  <b>Had to happen</b> - <i>by SnakeEyes_YT on June 20th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
Today, we fired head coach Harley Berman. After a remarkable first season with Berman at the helm, we thought this was the man we'd follow for a decade. Unfortunately, after the season where we made the tournament, his inactivity in the recruiting field has doomed us. A terrible season followed by 2 below-average seasons, and we had to move on. We hired Rod Birch, and I am ecstatic to announce Birch as the new head coach of the CMU Mules.<br /><br /><br />

Mar 01 2025:  <b>Unfortunate End, 2025 Season Summary</b> - <i>by SnakeEyes_YT on April 26th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
After an awful 6-35 2024 season, I decided to make some coaching changes. I replaced a pair of assistant coaches but left Head Coach Harley Berman in his place. PG Matt Baker and PF Nik Potocnik were the only players to graduate. In the recruiting field, we were able to bring in JUCO sophomore center Greg Brady. Then we brought in a pair of talented young high school seniors, Lawrence Willis and Gary Stewart. All 3 of these men were 3-star recruits. So I worked with  Coach Berman and we constructed our depth chart. The starting 5 for almost the entire season consisted of freshman Gary Stewart and Lawrence Willis, sophomore Joe Bailey, and juniors Greg Brady and Grant Schwartz. All 4 seniors on the roster would come off the bench. Although our starting 5 were greatly inexperienced, they gave us the best shot to win. However, the season didn't begin that way. We played an extremely difficult non-conference schedule and were winless in non-conference play. Our SOS at the point was near .600. But this team battled and won our first conference game of the year on a buzzer-beater against Siena. Then we continued to play well in conference play. We were in the upper half of the conference for nearly the entire season until the end when we dropped to 9th. We ended the season 16-14 in conference play and 16-25 overall. So not a good season by any means, but it's difficult to be upset when your roster is extremely inexperienced and you just went through a 6-35 season. Unfortunately in round #1 of the conference tournament, we fell to North Florida by 6. We struggled from deep and our big men couldn't get going. Still, the development I have seen from these players makes me look forward to greatness. We will be losing 6 seniors to graduation, but they all either never played or came off the bench. Coach Berman and I are working hard in the recruitment field to add some bench pieces to this roster. Very excited for the 2026 season. LETS GO MULES!<br /><br /><br />

Nov 16 2024:  <b>buzzer beater against siena</b> - <i>by SnakeEyes_YT on March 27th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
In our first conference game of the season, Kendall Bianchi, a 6'9" senior off the bench buried a deep 3 at the buzzer. The final score was 97-95. It is this team's first victory of the year. What a way to do it. The Mules have grown so much over these 11 games and I only see them continuing to improve. <br /><br /><br />

Jan 20 2024:  <b>Huge Recruiting Year</b> - <i>by SnakeEyes_YT on February 17th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
This season, as president of CMSU it has been difficult to be happy about this team. They have struggled day in and day out. But, in the recruiting field, the coaches excelled. They brought in 2 3-star high school seniors, PG Lawrence Willis and PF Gary Stewart. Lastly, they were able to snag JUCO sophomore, Greg Brady. Greg Brady is a 3-star center that was heavily sought after. I expect all of these new recruits to get a lot of playing time in 2025.<br /><br /><br />

Dec 28 2023:  <b>Buzzer Beater</b> - <i>by SnakeEyes_YT on February 10th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
After a historic last 2022 season, the Mules have been terrible this year. But the team put together a solid game yesterday. Kendall Bianchi tipped in shot at the buzzer to defeat Chicago State. <br /><br /><br />
