Nov 02 2041:  <b>New President at the helm</b> - <i>by Willowww on October 29th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
This is Willow, the new president of your OWU Bishops. I hope to bring glory to this team and this insitution. Go Battlin' Bishops.<br /><br /><br />

Oct 03 2019:  <b>Building Blocks</b> - <i>by dkiley47 on June 7th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The big news that shocked the alumni and fanbase was beloved Coach Murphy was fired out of nowhere. The AD Kiley was quoted "It was a very tough decision we decided to make. Murphy brought the Battling Bishops to new heights reaching the Division 2 and 3 tournaments the last two years on top of finishing in the top 10 last year in the rankings. Though we decided to part ways with him for a young up an coming coach Khris Singleton due to focus on defense and development of our young players. We look for him to continue to build off the relationships with the recruits we are heavily involved with and look eagerly to see how our team meshes with the new staff."<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see how recruits react. The big fish Ohio Wesleyan are heavily in on is 10th overall rank recruit Joe Sanbord who lives less than an hour away. If they land him the coaching staff hopes he will attract other great talent such as SG Darren Burks who tweeted after hearing the news of Coach Murphy's firing "I'm shocked, definitely could have seen myself playing for him one day. Will keep an open mind to Coach Singleton." We will see how the start to the season unfolds. Will star Thaddeus Fountain build off his strong junior year and leave a lasting legacy here. Will someone else step up to catapult our Battling Bishops to new levels? That is where things look grim unfortunately as our teams top 4 players are all seniors. Let's hope the development that Coach Singleton brings to the table will ensure a boost for the young players for next year and the years to come!<br />
<br />
Signing off for now. Go Battling Bishops and best of luck to Coach Singleton!   <br /><br /><br />

Mar 11 2018:  <b>Conference Champs and Possible Cinderella in the D3 Tourney?</b> - <i>by dkiley47 on April 2nd, 2021</i> <br /><br />
It's good being on top of the Conference. Our first year head coach gave us a quote "We had a rough start to the year, and that's on me because we didn't have a great offseason to implement my system. I give all the credit to my players for believing in my system and coaching staff. They have grown so much this year and have made me so proud. Louis and Haynes have been huge for us this year and they deserve much credit for leading this team to this universities 3rd Conference Tournament Win, and 3rd D3 Tournament bid. We will make sure we stick around longer than we have in the past though!" Coach Murphy said.<br />
<br />
We asked the AD to comment and he said "This is our year to make the cinderella team's proud. We are on fire over the last 28 games going 26-2 in them. I really feel like we can make a deep run this year. I made the decision to fire Coach Earley before the season started due to poor recruiting, and the decline in the past 2 years. I knew this roster had what it took to be great, but I knew a coaching changed was needed. I hired Coach Murphy, because of his prestige, and his background. He has been great, and much more than I could have asked for. Our offense and defense has been phenomenal, and even though he isn't recruiting we made sure to surround him with elite assistant coaches. It has paid huge dividends for us because of receiving 6 commits this year and a top 15 recruiting class. I have never been more excited for the Battling Bishops future."<br />
<br />
As you can see the passion that Coach Murphy has for his team, and the program. Having an AD who is very pleased makes your job that much easier. I would concur Ohio Wesleyan has a bright future.<br />
<br />
Go Battling Bishops! Let's make that run deep!<br />

Feb 08 2018:  <b>Breathing New Life</b> - <i>by dkiley47 on March 22nd, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The season is well underway and Ohio Wesleyan is enjoying huge success under new Head Coach Gregg Murphy. Currently riding a 9 game win streak and huge recruiting success. Having landed their 4th commitment of the season as they push for a top 15 recruiting class that has yielded the commitment of 4-star long time recruit and #2 JUCO player Thaddeus Fountain.<br />
<br />
They still have two more slots left in their class as they look to bring in a Center and Shooting Guard. With the regular season coming to an end, expect and even harder push by Coach Murphy for the Regular Season title and Conference Tourney Title. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_897'></a>
Mar 06 2014:  <b>Exciting Future</b> - <i>by dkiley47 on August 18th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
Ohio Wesleyan is super excited to announce our new President, dkiley47.<br />
<br />
His goals for the program are to bring titles to the university who has only been to the tournament since 2003. In his first step as President, he fired Felix Orlando who had been with the team for 4 years, and he lead them to their first tournament. Though his success was great the last two years, dkiley47 knew the way to win is through recruiting and he felt it could be done better. He is excited to announce Donny Earley as the new coach of the Battling Bishops! Earley said about the opportunity "I'm super excited to get a chance to lead this young team. They have a exciting future and foundation that I plan to grow on and off the field."<br /><br /><br />
