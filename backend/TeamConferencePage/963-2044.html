Mar 05 2043:  <b>Nor&#39;Easters Hit Twenty Year Low, Coach Beard Let Go</b> - <i>by rlawrence on January 27th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
In a close relegation battle, UNE was just points shy of winning the tie-breaker and staying up. Instead, and for the first time in 20 seasons, they drop down to LL4.<br />
<br />
Twenty-year Coach Stan Beard was immediately let go.<br />
<br />
"Listen, Stan is one of the reasons we were able to climb all the way to Legends and make it to a Tournament Final," said President Lawrence, "We appreciate everything he's done for us, but everyone know's we've been declining for sometime. It's just time for new blood."<br />
<br />
And new blood it is! Coach Tommy Vinson is a local hero from New England just getting started as the Lead man.  Known for his cutting edge systems on offense and defense, He's sure to bring something new to the club.<br />
<br />
<br /><br /><br />

Apr 04 2039:  <b>UNE Finishes Third Straight Winning Season in II.1</b> - <i>by rlawrence on June 27th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
The Nor'Easters have posted another winning season in II.1, bringing their Conference record to 51-39 over the last three seasons.<br />
<br />
"We've tried to stay in 'the hunt' every year, you never know when you can just make that push", rlawrence stated.  "We even got a win over Tournament Champions STA this year.  Sadly, we're losing three great players to graduation, but that's the way the business works"<br />
<br />
Fans are a bit less optimistic as they look at the underclassmen, wondering if there will be enough depth and talent to avoid relegation next year, much less make a run.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3914'></a>
Sep 02 2038:  <b>Injury Plagued Season Limits UNE to Mediocrity</b> - <i>by rlawrence on May 3rd, 2024</i> <br /><br />
As the sun set on season 2038, UNE nearly topped the II.1 leader-board with a very important statistic ... injuries. Most notable being their prolific, 6'9" senior PG, Patrick Prince.<br />
<br />
The hopes for Prince were very high at the beginning of the season, some projecting him to be the All-League PG, or perhaps even challenge for the highest scorer in the league.  But down the stretch he just couldn't stay healthy, suffering a trifecta of injuries that put him on the bench for 8 conference games.<br />
<br />
Rookie PG Holder was called on to do much more than he could handle and by the time Prince was healthy again, with only 3 games left, the Nor'Easters were out of contention for promotion.<br />
<br />
Fans got a healthy preview of the upcoming young talent to finish off the season. With Prince gone, and Fair being drafted into the NBA with the #17 pick, it's likely the Nor'easters will have another mid-table winning season next year.<br />
<br />
Senior SG Pat Rogers hopes to have something to say about that. In the void left with the injured Prince he stepped up to the plate in a big way, becoming the engine for the offense and securing the All-Conference SG award. He has another full season ahead of him and hopes to make an even bigger impact.<br />
<br /><br /><br />

Sep 02 2032:  <b>Legend</b> - <i>by rlawrence on June 2nd, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Sixteen seasons ago, manager rlawrence walked into a quaint little school in Maine and called it home.<br />
<br />
They were in the bottom league in the nation with zero prestige and little hope.  It took some time for him to put together a winning culture. The team had its ups and downs, but in the last two seasons, everything clicked. Division III.3 Championship followed by a Division II.2 Championship, they fought and clawed there way to a D1 Tourney Finals. The final game did not go their way, but they're smiling today as the bad-news New England Nor'Easters sport the #2 Ranking in the World, and an entrance to the League of Legends.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3158'></a>
Mar 13 2031:  <b>Nor&#39;Easters Bring Home the Trophy</b> - <i>by rlawrence on April 2nd, 2023</i> <br /><br />
After two seasons in LL3, UNE is headed back up to the 2nd Conference group, and with bigger dreams.<br />
<br />
In a spectacular 1st place season with 34 wins and a ten game win streak, President rlawrence believes the team can do even greater things.<br />
<br />
"We're only losing one of our starters to graduation this year, and the boys are hungry for more"<br />
<br />
This statement came after a disappointing 1st round loss to Alabama in the tourney.<br />
<br />
"Once the dust settles, we'll dig into the details, but it Legends or bust for us this coming year"<br /><br /><br />
