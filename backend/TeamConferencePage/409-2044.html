Apr 04 2043:  <b>Graduating Class of 2043: Dix & Dial</b> - <i>by Tali on February 5th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
<a href="../../../player/196085" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Kendrick Dix</a> (6' 1" 185 PG sg 190/13)<br />
Kendrick was a high school prodigy. He logged minutes at all 5 positions as a HS freshman despite standing just 5' 5½". He quickly settled into his preferred position of PG and scored over 1750 points for Muskogee High. He was a 5-star recruit and rose to be the #1 recruit in the nation in the 2040 class. Ever up for a challenge he joined an already stacked ECU backcourt where he won minutes at both guard positions immediately and quickly moved into the starting lineup (25 starts as a freshman). He would help the Tigers capture the 2040 II.2 conference title, East Central had climbed the mountain and would promote to Legends for the first time in their history. A first round loss to American University fueled his fire for greater post season success moving forward.<br />
<br />
In 2041 he became the full time starter at PG posting 12.8ppg 5.9apg including a career best .455 from three. The Tigers would finish 4th in their Legends debut season and reach the Sweet Sixteen for the first time (Tennessee &gt; Houston Baptist &gt; Alabama).<br />
<br />
The weight of expectation loomed large in 2042 as the stacked backcourt were almost all upperclassmen, the exception being rising sophomore sensation Cushman. Dix was posted 12.7ppg 6.6apg but was a little less efficient and a bit worse defensively as the team never quite reached the heights expected of them, they slid back to 5th in Legends, though they once again made the Sweet Sixteen (VCU &gt; Navy &gt; Emporia State). Dix reached his peak 2042.<br />
<br />
With much of the vaunted backcourt graduating at the end of 2042, it was undoubtedly time to shine for the duo of Dix and Cushman in 2043. Jumping up to 31+ minutes for the first time and the offensive focus shifting to the backcourt Dix put up 17.3ppg 7.2apg with a slight uptick in efficiency due to the increased number of 3PA. The Tigers once again finished 5th in Legends, this time making it to the Elite Eight (Westfield State &gt; Texas Tech &gt; Ursinus &gt; UCLA)<br />
<br />
Not gifted with blazing speed or amazing lateral quickness he utilised a combination of limitless range, scintillating passing and elite handles and driving to play at his own speed and get wherever he wanted to on the court. His arrival and success elevated the team to new levels for which the school and fanbase will forever be grateful.<br />

<a href="../../../player/189710" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">"T.E." Homer Dial</a> (6'10" 240 C 138/10)<br />
A 2-star recruit with limited upside would none-the-less start 137 games, 132 of them in Legends. I'm not sure I've ever had a player do more with less. Early in his career he had Stanley Sawyer and Kenny Day to learn from, but with Sawyer graduating after Dial's freshman season he was suddenly thrust into the starting lineup. He wasn't tall enough, he couldn't shoot, he couldn't finish, he wasn't strong enough, the scouts knocked his handles. He didn't care. No doubt he benefitted from some excellent guard play, but he was effective, often against some of the biggest name C's in the college game. He graduates with career averages of 10.8p (.560/.250/.640 eFG:.560) 7.8r 0.6a 0.8s 1.4b OeFG:.464, I think that last number might be the most impressive given the level of competition.<br />

156/11 <a href="../../../player/185427" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">"Sticky" Ricky O'Neil</a> (2* 6' 9" 235 lbs PF C) 2038 SR #16<br />
<br />
3 of them watched the promotion to LL3 whilst redshirting and then all 4 were involved in 2 promotions from LL3 to LL1 and 2 seasons in Legends for 4th and 5th placed finishes.<br />
<br />
The Duke played SG as a freshmen and then split time at both SG and SF for his final 3 years. Eventually playing about two thirds of his time at SG. He was a very good perimeter defender (OFG:.406 OeFG:..489), a steady scorer (14.7ppg @eFG:.571) and generally did most things well. Some knocked his passing, but even that finished with career 1.9apg to 1.6topg.<br />
<br />
Lord Beaumont might be the best guard I've ever not started for a season. He was behind former great "Sezz" Jayson Simon for 2 years, and then Kendrick Dix joined the team and leap-frogged him. He was a steady combo guard that averaged 16+mpg, about two thirds at PG and one third at SG. Until his senior year he was a reliable 3-point threat, but his outside shot abandoned him as a senior.<br />
<br />
Sticky only started as a senior, behind some quality bigs for much of his career. A genuine ranged threat, he was solid defensively and on the glass, but his speed, driving and passing sometimes resulted in taking too many contested shots.<br />
<br />
A year after that trio signed they were joined by 5-star Huntley. With Duke and Lord already on the team he was named "Master Of The Hunt", which was shortened to MOTH. Despite being a bit undersized for the position he played mostly and SF and even played some PF as a senior. A great secondary play-maker, defender and decently efficient low-volume scorer he was a luxury glue-guy who won a starting position early in his sophomore season and only relinquished it very late to the fast developing Lonnie Cushman.<br />
<br />
<br />
As their collective stars rose, the quality of the frontcourt slowly degraded which was certainly a factor in them not having the senior year that they might have hoped for. Still, they were part of a number of very good teams and particularly epic backcourts. Truly their four seasons were a golden age for the East Central Tigers program.<br /><br /><br />

Apr 02 2039:  <b>2039 The Rollercoaster Continues</b> - <i>by Tali on June 27th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
ECU's recent history has been full of highs and lows.<br />
<br />
Since 2033 ECU have double promoted, double demoted, and have just completed double-promoting again.<br />
<br />
This season's recruiting has been a microcosm of that experience.<br />
<br />
ECU won the services of the #1 recruit in the nation Kendrick Dix.<br />
<br />
All attention then turned to long-time lead Brady Hoppe, but the big man went with LL6 Tulsa. Leaving a gaping hole in the Tiger's long-term frontcourt plans.<br />
<br />
Greg Pinckney is a workman-like forward who was acquired late and cheap when another team ran out of scholarships.<br />
<br />
Almost as heartbreaking as Hoppe was 4-star guard/wing Stephen Scarpa who developed off court troubles as a senior and was not able to sort them out in time to enroll.<br /><br /><br />
