Apr 03 2023:  <b>2023 Season</b> - <i>by Cxhawk93 on January 14th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
The 2023 Season was a success. We Finished with a  31-12 (24-6) and earned a promotion back to    Division 1. Coach Ike Abney, in his second season has a 57-27(41-19) overall record has done a masterful job guiding us back to the big league. "There is a lot of talent returning on the roster" says Abney "I think were set up for sustained success". One of the reasons for that is the return of Conference V.7 player of the year Al Albertson. Averaging 17.7 ppg 4.9 reb 1.8 ast	1.6 stl. Albertson says he is looking forward to leading his team to another promotion and he wants to beat the Rivals. "2024 is going to be a fun one"<br /><br /><br />

Apr 02 2018:  <b>Aggies Double Promote!</b> - <i>by Cxhawk93 on April 8th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The North Carolina A&amp;T Aggies are promoting again. After Promoting to division 2 just last year with a record of 40-8 the Aggies once again move up. Finishing the season up with a 37-9 the aggies went on to advace to the elite 8 for the seconf year in a row. While the aggies fell short of their tournoment goal they are checking off other accomplishments. The Aggies Head Coach "coach Braxton" has been with the program since taking over at the end of the 2010 season this marks 8 years with the program. When asked about his time with the program coach Braxton had this to say " when I got here we sucked. I believe we won 9 games the season before I got here. The recruiting was bad, The President was bad, the fans sucked, and the players were awful. Even the water boy was garbage. It wasnt easy, their were times I thought about stepping down but we changed the culture here. NC A&amp;T is about winning and since Ive been here I believe I have done just that" Returning every starter from a Historic season has the Aggies dreaming big. "We want to win it all and I believe we have the horses to do just that"<br /><br /><br />
