Feb 28 2043:  <b>An Early Senior Day In Collegeville</b> - <i>by Ndsam05 on January 25th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Despite having two home games remaining before the regular season comes to an end, the Johnnies have elected for their next matchup against Franklin &amp; Marshall to be the last timethe class of 2043 will touch the court in Sexton arena. The class, including cornerstone guards John Dotson and Johnnie Coulter, will be honored in what is sure to be an emotional send-off.<br />
Asked about the decision today, coach Elliot Cummings had this to say:<br />
"Obviously it't a tough call because with so few games left you hate to take away a chance for these guys to play here, but I talked with the guys and I think we all agreed that, when it comes down to it, we want to be our best in the postseason and the best way to be that is to be rested. We've had a tough season, but we've been in a lot of games and we feel like if we're rested and playing well, we have the guys to make a run in the conference playoff and we all agree that's where our priorities are."<br />
John Dotson, the face of this senior class, chimed in to discuss the decision and his thought process.<br />
"It's tough, we all love playing in front of these fans, and it'll sting to be on the bench that last game, but I'm excited to watch these young guys play and we'll be as ready as we have all season for those conference playoff games, I guarantee you that this season's a long way from over."   <br /><br /><br />

Mar 20 2042:  <b>Meet The Newest Johnnies</b> - <i>by Ndsam05 on December 9th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
With the recruiting class now complete, Saint John's is delighted to welcome in a group that will hopefully bring this team to new heights in the coming years.<br />
Gilbert Abernathy comes in as the local kid who seems to have all the makings of a reliable offensive orchestrator and shot-maker, and brings the extra bonus of being an excellent locker room presence.<br />
Abdoulaye Ndiaye brings a similar skillset although most around the program believe that he's more naturally talented than Abernathy. He's an energetic competitor who gets more fired up than anyone on the court.<br />
Lewis Bruno is a slightly undersized forward who is believed to have easily the best scoring tools of these freshman, with very high-level post moves and shooting touch, although he also comes in with potential concerns about a lack of consistent effort on the court.<br />
Finally, Julius Austin is a big man who, like Bruno, has all of the raw scoring tools you look for, but is extremely raw. If Austin can buy in and work hard to develop, he can become a key contributor much sooner than later. <br /><br /><br />

Oct 23 2041:  <b>New Standards Coming to SJU</b> - <i>by Ndsam05 on October 27th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
After an embarrassing blowout loss to Christopher Newport, the school's new president had harsh words for the team.<br />
"It's clear this team has no identity, we can't defend and we can't score, so what can we do? I think coach Grover's done a lot of good here, but if he doesn't prove himself this year, we'll be searching for a replacement when the season ends. We need to set higher expectations in recruiting, in development, and most importantly, in results. Nothing about this team is good enough, and I plan to overhall every aspect of this program. We need to be better." <br /><br /><br />
