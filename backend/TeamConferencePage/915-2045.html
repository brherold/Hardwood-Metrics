Apr 04 2044:  <b>Head Coach Hill Heads for the Hills... Now, Hoss is Boss</b> - <i>by grayman on April 3rd, 2025</i> <br /><br />
After 23 years on the Methodist coaching staff, Reid Hill is on the outs in Fayetteville. Brought in by Coach Upchurch as an assistant during the 2020 season, the man known as "The Professor" excelled at teaching the game and getting the best out of his players. As Head Coach, Professor Hill led the Monarchs to an 18-8 Tournament record, including 6 Sweet Sixteen appearances, 3 Elite Eights and 2 Final Fours. He also stands as the winningest coach in Monarchs history with 390 wins. Unfortunately, after back-to-back down years that saw the team fall from Legends to LL3, it seems the Professor has lost tenure.<br />
<br />
Filling his shoes will be Otis "Hoss" Martin. A former DIII Head Coach, Hoss joined the Monarchs as an assistant two years ago; his dramatic rise to the top flight of college basketball has been a spectacular display in failing upwards. Hopefully he brings the same upward trajectory to Meth-U... minus the failing part.<br /><br /><br />

Apr 02 2040:  <b>2040 MethU Recap - Teamwork Makes the Dream Work</b> - <i>by grayman on August 23rd, 2024</i> <br /><br />
FAYETTEVILLE, NC<br />
Coming into the 2040 basketball season, the future of the Methodist University Monarchs was uncertain. With the loss of team captain Preston Sullivan, Monarchs fans were left wondering who would step up to carry the torch...<br />
<br />
The answer? EVERYONE.<br />
<br />
After fighting through a gauntlet of a non-conference schedule, the Monarchs entered II.1 play with a 4-6 record and a chip on their shoulder. Their early season struggles brought them together, and they became a cohesive, well-balanced unit. Six players averaged double-digit points, and the team averaged more assists than at any time since the Hall-Chambers-Gomoto era. <a href="../../../player/186021" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">"Dizzy" Dave Ziegler</a> left defenders spinning in the post, while the <a href="../../../player/174673" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">"General Perk-titioner"</a> set up a three point clinic beyond the arc. <a href="../../../player/174543" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Stan Spears</a> did the dirty work, while <a href="../../../player/179980" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">"Walt Diggsney"</a> provided a huge spark off the bench. <a href="../../../player/188668" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Louie Burley</a> provided energy and much needed defensive intensity; this won him II.1 Freshman of the Year. And <a href="../../../player/181352" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Miles Voigt</a> was also there, holding down the point.<br />
<br />
By the power of friendship, the Monarchs reached new heights this season.<br />
They won their first regular season championship --at any level-- in team history.<br />
They capped it off with a conference tourney win, and a shot in the big dance.<br />
And, in the end, they earned a second straight Sweet Sixteen berth, which sadly ended in an overtime thriller against Grand View.<br />
<br />
As the 2040 season comes to a close, we salute every member of this Monarchs team. Most importantly, let's give special recognition to our graduates:<br />
SG George Perkins ("General Perk-titioner")<br />
C Denny Perkins ("Central Perk")<br />
PG Miles Voigt ("The Void")<br />
PF Stanley Spears ("SS55")<br />
<br />

Apr 03 2032:  <b>Tournament Season</b> - <i>by grayman on May 31st, 2023</i> <br /><br />
It is the best of times, it is the worst of times.<br />
It is a time of victory, it is a time of defeat.<br />
It is a spring of hope, it is a winter of despair.<br />
<br />
We have seen the last become first -- #16 Iona defeated #1 La Tech.<br />
We have seen two firsts become last -- Sioux Falls and UNE, both first in their conference, are now the last teams standing.<br />
<br />
Nowhere is the duality of the tournament more apparent than at Methodist University. For the third straight year, the Methodist Monarchs have made a deep tourney run. For the straight third year, the Monarchs have been eliminated from a deep tourney run. There is hope in this: after years of mid, we are now a legit contender. There is also despair: much like the C's in the playoffs, we struggle to finish the job.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow, the season will end. Tomorrow, a champion will be crowned. Tomorrow, the struggle begins anew.<br />
<br /><br /><br />

Mar 20 2031:  <b>No More Method to the Madness</b> - <i>by grayman on April 3rd, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Jesus is on our side, but he gets very little playing time.<br />
<br />
Due to popular outcry, we will never, not ever, EVER post ANY press releases in the middle of the tournament. Ever again. Only sorrow and pain can come of that. On a semi-related note, Dick Payne had the game of his career.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to the Kangaroos, thanks for a fun (if heartbreaking) season finale. Mead is a bucket, should be a tough out.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3160'></a>
Mar 15 2031:  <b>Method to the Madness</b> - <i>by grayman on April 2nd, 2023</i> <br /><br />
For the second year in a row, Methodist is headed to the Sweet Sixteen.<br />
How did we do it?<br />
<br />
We had <a href="../../../player/148627" class="bbcode_url" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Jesus</a> on our side. (Also, Bryce Chambers)<br /><br /><br />
