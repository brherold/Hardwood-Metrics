Oct 30 2021:  <b>Pat Carson Inducted Into Lipscomb Basketball Hall of Fame</b> - <i>by Rdub29317 on October 4th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
One of the best two-year players in Lipscomb Bisons history got honored by the program before the game against Maine Maritime Academy, as Pat Carson got inducted into the program’s Hall of Fame.<br />
<br />
“Pat was and still is a tremendous player” said President Rdub29317, “he helped push this program to the next level in his time here and he deserves a lot of credit for where the program is today.”<br />
<br />
While the counting stats don’t jump out too much when compared to some other Bison greats, it is important to remember that Carson only played two seasons with Lipscomb. The Nashville native played two years of college at nearby Cleveland State Community College.<br />
<br />
“I am forever thankful for my time here,” Carson said during his ceremony, “Nashville is my home, and this program is a tremendous part of this city. I am happy to have played a part in what this program is today.”<br />
<br />
Carson was surrounded by former teammates and coaches, and was able to squeeze a trip back to the Nashville Bible School in his busy schedule as a member of the Seattle SuperSonics. Carson was the first Lipscomb player ever taken in the Pro Draft when he was selected 44th overall in 2018.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Pat Carson for his well-deserved induction into the Lipscomb Bisons Basketball Hall of Fame!<br /><br /><br />

Oct 24 2020:  <b>Gonzalo Carrasco Inducted into the Lipscomb Basketball Hall of Fame</b> - <i>by Rdub29317 on August 6th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
During halftime of today's game against crosstown rival Vanderbilt, former Lipscomb Bison Gonzalo Carrasco was inducted into the Bisons Basketball Hall of Fame.<br />
<br />
"It's a dream come true and such an honor," Carrasco said of the achievement. "This school and this program mean so much to me, so it means a lot to get my name up in the rafters here at Allen Arena."<br />
<br />
Carrasco was truly one of the greats to put on a Lipscomb uniform. He currently holds career and single-season program records in multiple categories including scoring, rebounding, steals and Game MVP awards. He is the only Lipscomb player in history to win a Freshman of the Year award, Conference Player of the Year award, and be named to the All-Conference team twice in his collegiate career.<br />
<br />
"We are so proud of Gonzalo and everything he has accomplished," said Lipscomb Basketball President Rdub29317. "This induction was always a matter of when rather than if, so to finally make it happen is awesome."<br />
<br />
Carrasco becomes just the third member of the Lipscomb Hall of Fame, joining Roscoe Schuster and Curtis Mead, who were both in attendance for Carrasco's crowning moment.<br />
<br />
"I was here as a player for when both Roscoe and Curtis were inducted, and in my five years playing here I built a great bond with them," Carrasco said. "I wouldn't be here without them, or any of the rest of the Lipscomb family I am so thankful to be a part of."<br />
<br />
Former Head Coach and the program's all time coaching wins leader Brady Staples was in attendance, as well as many former teammates including Tony Naranjo, who is from the same recruiting class as Carrasco.<br />
<br />
"It's a special day to honor a special player who is an even more special young man," said Staples, who addressed the crowd and introduced Carrasco during the ceremony. "His impact on this program and this community is immeasurable, and he fully deserves everything that comes with this prestigious distinction."<br />
<br />
The crowd gave their loudest cheer of the night as the banner with the #34 on it rose to the rafters of Allen Arena.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Gonzalo Carrasco for his induction to the Lipscomb Basketball Hall of Fame!<br /><br /><br />

Oct 15 2020:  <b>Lipscomb 2021 Season Preview: New Era, Next Level</b> - <i>by Rdub29317 on August 4th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
As the Lipscomb Bisons enter their first LL3 season in 12 years, there is a new sense of excitement around the program, especially compared to the last time they were in this spot.<br />
<br />
“It’s been a lot of hard work to get to this point” said team President Rdub29317 at his pre-season press conference, “but we feel we are only just at the beginning of something special.”<br />
<br />
Because being at LL3 is something that has happened in the program before, it is only natural to compare where the program is now compared to 2008. Those Bisons were coming off of a similarly successful year and promotion from LL4, led by the legendary Roscoe Schuster. However, they lost a lot of talent going into the 2008 season, and didn’t have a single signee in their previous recruiting class. The same cannot be said for the program this time around. The Bisons signed the 23rd best recruiting class of any team in the nation, by far the best ranking in program history.<br />
<br />
“This group of new guys is a culmination of everything we have wanted to put together here at Lipscomb,” said Head Coach Louis Howard, going into his 3rd year at the helm of the Nashville Bible School. “To say we are excited is an understatement.”<br />
<br />
The headliner of that class is Rodger Bowman, a five-star recruit and the 8th ranked high school player in the entire country last year. Bowman lit up the scene from his small hometown of Jasper, Tennessee and is now expected to make an immediate impact on this Lipscomb team as a true freshman. While many expected Bowman to be in the starting lineup, some believe he’ll be slotted into a bench utility role this season.<br />
<br />
Either way, Bowman sounds ready for the challenge.<br />
<br />
“Whatever the team needs from me I am ready,” Bowman said. “When they recruited me we talked about how the program has been built on a bit of a ‘next man up’ kind of mentality. Few people have come in and started right away and done so for 4 years no matter how good they are. If they feel what’s best for the team is to come off the bench, then I’m all in.”<br />
<br />
Other key contributors are expected to be seniors Markell Knight and Abdoulaye Maiga. Knight is taking over the role of team captain from former high school teammate Nicolas Molina, who graduated and became the second ever Bison taken in the pro draft after being selected 28th overall by Boston. Maiga, who hails from Mali, has grown into an impactful player on both sides of the ball. The third senior is Tony Howe, a sharpshooter from Nashville who played in Junior College before coming to Lipscomb.<br />
<br />
The rest of the rotation returns a good mix of production and potential. Christopher Barbieri is a big, athletic guard the staff is very high on. The same can be said for Jacob Muller, who is expected to start this season. JuCo product Frank Tsuda, also known as “Toaster”, is expected to start at the 5 in his first year on campus, while Zack Muse and Walt Saunders are back as the second front court unit. Justin Price showed great flashes last year as a redshirt, and the team wants to see him get regular minutes this season to help him reach his potential. Incoming freshman Jerald Crutchfield is the only player expected to redshirt, but he could be a high impact player as soon as next season.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been able to say this for the past few years, but I feel this is our best group to date in terms of talent” said Rdub. “I probably sound like a broken record at this point, but I hope I never stop feeling that way. Each year I want us to get better and better, right now we are trending in that direction.”<br /><br /><br />

Mar 21 2020:  <b>Lipscomb Season Ends, Eliminated in Sweet 16</b> - <i>by Rdub29317 on July 27th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
After a trailblazing year, the Lipscomb Bisons tournament run has come to an end in the Sweet 16 in a 96-71 loss to Bentley.<br />
<br />
"It certainly isn't how we wanted the year to end," said Head Coach Louis Howard, "but I think this group can be very proud of what they have accomplished."<br />
<br />
With a 35-12 record, these Bisons won the most games at the Division 1 level in program history. They also won their first regular season conference championship at the Division 1 level in program history. Lipscomb also captured their conference tournament trophy as well, marking 2020 as the first season in program history in which they won multiple trophies.<br />
<br />
"We are very proud of this group, they set a new bar for what is expected here at Lipscomb," said President Rdub29317. "I have no doubt we will take what this group did and look to expand it into the future to continue to grow the program and make us better."<br />
<br />
The program as a whole is in a very healthy place, coming off of the most successful D1 season the school has ever seen, they also bring in a top 25 recruiting class in the country that will look to push the Bisons to new heights in their time in Nashville.<br />
<br />
"We still think the best is yet to come," said Rdub, "and we can't wait to get it started."<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1885'></a>
Mar 14 2020:  <b>Lipscomb Downs Richmond, Advances to Sweet 16!</b> - <i>by Rdub29317 on July 25th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The Lipscomb Bisons have reached another new milestone for the program, their first trip to the Division 1 Sweet 16!<br />
<br />
With their 91-74 win over 2nd seeded Richmond, the 2020 Lipscomb Bisons have now gone further than any team has gone in the D1 tournament in program history.<br />
<br />
"It's a great accomplishment, and we are very proud" said 2nd year Head Coach Louis Howard, "but we also feel like we are not done yet. This group believes in itself and really wants to keep winning. They want to achieve as much as possible, this is a great milestone towards that."<br />
<br />
This trip to the Sweet 16 is accompanied by the program's first season winning multiple trophies, after claiming the IV.2 Regular Season and Tournament championships this year.<br />
<br />
"We are doing things that this program has never done before, that isn't lost on us" said senior forward Nicholas Molina, the team's leading scorer, "but I feel like with this group it is just motivating us to continue to push forward. Why can't we keep breaking those barriers? Why not us?"<br />
<br />
The Bisons have accumulated a 35-11 record on the season so far, and they are currently on a 9 game winning streak. This team has been heralded all year for their defensive toughness and overall depth of talent. 7 players on the roster average at least 7 points per game, and they have been one of the best teams in the country at forcing turnovers.<br />
<br />
"This team from top to bottom I feel like is the best group since I have gotten here," said President Rdub29317. "One through ten, all of these guys can play and contribute at a high level. There hasn't been a team like that for us until this year. It has been exciting to watch all season."<br />
<br />
In the Sweet 16, the Bisons will take on 11th seeded Bentley, who have a great arsenal of athletic offensive weapons at their disposal. The winner makes the Elite 8, which would be Bentley's first since 2015.<br /><br /><br />
