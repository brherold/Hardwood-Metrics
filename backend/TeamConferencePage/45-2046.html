<h3>Press Releases:</h3>
<a id='releases_4315'></a>
Mar 02 2045:  <b>Thank You Seniors: 2045</b> - <i>by Twolvesfan21 on May 19th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Stu Beyer wasn't always hitting his shots, but when he was, it was special. Beyer spent four years in Morgattown being the most confident and energetic player on the floor and for better or worse, kept shooting whether he was 0-8 or 6-9 from deep. Every Mountaineer fan will always have a different favorite Stu Beyer game.<br />
Steward Emerson arrived as a walkon but turned himself into a three year starter who was the definition of consistency. Every game for those 3 years, Emerson was ready to grab a rebound, block a shot at the rim, or dominate in the post. We'll miss Steward Emerson't steady and constant presence at the 5.  <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4309'></a>
Feb 18 2045:  <b>Ouch</b> - <i>by Twolvesfan21 on May 15th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Maybe the reason a 5-star would want to come here is that WVU's downward spiral is still more wins in a higher division than Bluefield State being on the rise. Guess Alphonso's standards were higher than 7 wins in D3. Ouch. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4307'></a>
Feb 18 2045:  <b>5 star</b> - <i>by Twolvesfan21 on May 15th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Alphonso Harrell made the right choice today by signing with the West Virginia Mountaineers. While it was rumured that he was also considering Bluefield State, their president's rude and abrasive nature was the third strike, the first two being that the team is both bad and has no history. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4243'></a>
Apr 02 2044:  <b>Thanking Carl Craven... FOR ABSOLUTE NOTHING</b> - <i>by Twolvesfan21 on April 3rd, 2025</i> <br /><br />
In his four years in Morgantown, Carl Craven never failed to disappoint. We'll never forget his incredible 38 percent from the field and 28 percent from three as easily the highest SI player on our team this year. We're all wishing Carl luck as he pursues his career as an accountant. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4146'></a>
Jan 24 2043:  <b>Robbins slams &quot;soft and selfish&quot; Mountaineers</b> - <i>by Twolvesfan21 on January 16th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
After remaining mostly composed throughout a brutal 3-26 season, long-time WVU coach Matthew Robbins finally cracked and spoke his mind about the team he's been coaching this year.<br />
"The reality is that we have a group of soft, selfish guys who refuse to play with any type of fire and refuse to play for each other. Iâ€™m not just saying that either, I'll name names. Beyer and Craven are a couple of selfish shot-chuckers who've never heard of team basketball in their lives, Beyer thinks he's Steph Curry and Craven clearly has never heard of showing energy off the ball in his life. Tolliver? Tolliver's what I'm talking about when I say soft, refuses to show any aggressiveness on offense, he's a talented shotmaker so I just don't get why his mentality is throw a swing pass to someone who's about to miss the shot anyway. Hershberger? Oh man he's lucky we don't have a ton of scholarship guys right now or he'd bee keeping that bench warm all game, don't know if I've ever seen that do anything except fail to drive inside and then shoot instead of playing good team ball.<br />
"For as much as I'd like to give some guys the pass, it's the whole team at this point, just the complete wrong mentality at every turn. I think it's time to make these kids work,  trust me, they'll be playing some more taxing basketball from now on."<br />
Note: The school's president has given coach Robbins his full vote of confidence in the face of these comments. <br /><br /><br />
