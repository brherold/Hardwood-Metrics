Sep 01 2044:  <b>Long Time Assistant Coach SACKED</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on April 4th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Fan favorite and long time Assistant <i>to</i> the Head Coach Enrique "Reek" Covarrubias was shown the exit on the morning of April 4th. A pillar of the program's construction, Covarrubias was considered for the gig of bench boss every time there was a vacancy in R.A. Faganel Hall. Unfortunately, the overachieving, long time Assistant <i>to</i> the Head Coach, was overlooked every opportunity that a promotion was available. Coach "Reek" was beloved by the players he coached and mentored during his tenure with Elmhurst, Coach Reek was given the privilege to mentor Elmhurst legends such as "Money" Moses, Eli Burnett, and Ron Howell.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Coach Reek was never given the opportunity due to his perceived lack of motivational skills, laissez faire approach to player development, and rough around the edges approach to recruiting prospects. Being one of President Hardin's first hires, Covarrubias's exit is tough for everyone in Elmhurst.<br />
<br />
Tensions came to a head during an end of season Coaches meeting when Coach Reek exclaimed that had the Boys in Blue used his scouting reports more often then maybe Coach Bowen's win percentage would be higher, and as a matter of fact, the Bluejays would have beaten Connecticut College in the Conference Semifinals had they switched McCune off of Barbour in an attempt to prevent the power forward from having a career day. A scuffle ensued between Coach Jon Bowen and his Assistant <i>to</i> the Head Coach began shoving and exchanging blows with each other while the other coaches and support staff attempted to break up the fight. Coach Reek walked out of the building under his own will, happy to finally get a fair shot at a head coaching gig.<br />
<br />
Coach Reek Covarrubias finished his time at Elmhurst helping the Bluejays to a 193-141 and a Conference Tournament Championship in 2043.<br /><br /><br />

Mar 05 2044:  <b>Big Recruiting Class Finalized</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on March 24th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
In a season of new milestones for Elmhurst, perhaps the most impressive feat has been the Class of 2044 recruiting class.<br />
Including the first 4 star recruit under President Hardin (Melvin Carlson), the '44 recruiting class boasts 2 other 3 star recruits hailing from Chicago.<br />
<br />
4 Star big Melvin Carlson gives Bluejays faithful something to look forward to for the next 5 years. The 51st ranked player in the nation and the number 1 recruit out of Arkansas, Melvin will bring his 3 level scoring abilities up north to Chicago. While he may be done growing, Coach Bowen is planning to get Mr. Carlson all of his minutes at the 4.<br />
<br />
3 Star PG "Blue" Lou Bell looks to fill the shoes of Clay Alexander as the primary ballhandler and orchestrator of the Bluejays offense. Blue Lou's incredible wingspan will help him spearhead the defensive attack for Coach Bowen. A 4.0 student and IHSA state finalist in the 100 and 200 meter dashes, Bell will be bringing loads of intelligence and speed to the bluejays back court.<br />
<br />
3 Star Combo Guard Les Worley will be arriving at Elmhurst as the 17th ranked player in the state of Illinois. While he is not projected to grow as tall as Blue Lou or be as quick, Les's lockdown defense and 3 level scoring ability with elite shooting from downtown will complement nicely with his future classmates offensive abilities.<br /><br /><br />

Mar 06 2042:  <b>New Coach, Same Choke</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on December 3rd, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Despite a rather successful regular season for the rookie bench boss, Jon Bowen, the Elmhurst Bluejays find themselves in a similar situation. Once again, the Boll Weevils of Arkansas-Monticello play spoiler for the Bluejays. With a 65-61 upset over Elmhurst, Arkansas-Monticello was able to utilize their bigs to gain the victory over the Boys in Blue for a second time this season.  Elmhurst hopes to advance to the D2 National Tournament and potentially make some noise while there. Coach Bowen looks to reverse Elmhurst's fortunes from recent years of early bounces and postseason couch surfing.<br /><br /><br />

Nov 09 2039:  <b>The Deep Dish Comes to Elmhurst!</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on July 10th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
In the Inaugural Chicagoland Shootout hosted by Dominican Illinois and Elmhurst, the Bluejays were able to go 3-0 and claim the first ever Deep Dish trophy.<br />
In a dominant win in their first matchup, the Bluejays were able to beat the Blueboys of Illinois College by 23 points.  Despite only shooting 64% from the charity stripe, Elmhurst was able to muscle their way to victory as IC was unable to contain the Bluejays' physicality around the rim resulting in 48 points in the paint and 46 rebounds (15 offensive).<br />
<br />
The Bluejays' second game of the shooutout was against the Redbirds of Illinois State University.  In a stark contrast from their first game, the Bluejays were able to overcome being out-rebounded, outscored in the paint and out-shot at the free throw line by letting it rain from deep.  Thanks to five, 3-balls a piece from K-Mac and Burnett and a double-double from big man Duane Walker, Elmhurst was able to win 93-80 over the Redbirds.<br />
<br />
It turned out to be a tale of two-halves (13 and 27 minutes) in what ultimately ended up being the championship game for the Chicagoland Shootout as the Bluejays secured The Deep Dish with a 19 point victory over their hometown rival- Dominican Illinois Stars.  Dominican was in the bonus not even five minutes into the game and had managed to hold Elmhurst to 10 points over the first nine minutes of the game.  Fortunes (or bribes?) changed soon thereafter as Elmhurst finished with 44 free throw attempts to the 18 of Dominican.  In a turn of luck, Elmhurst shot 37/44 from the charity stripe and most notably Tiny McIntosh with 15/17 and freshman Clay Alexander draining 8/8 from the line.  In a sloppy, foul fest of a game, the Bluejays were able to prevail 84-69.<br />
<br />
Chicagoland Shootout MVP: Eli Burnett<br />
Coming off the bench in 2 of the 3 games, Eli Burnett has proven to be one of Elmhurst's most productive players and efficient scorers.  Over the course of the shootout, Burnett totaled 48 points while shooting 8/17 from deep.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3949'></a>
Jan 13 2039:  <b>The Winning Combination?</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on June 2nd, 2024</i> <br /><br />
For the first time this season, the Elmhurst Bluejays have won back to back games while scoring more than 90 points. The difference? The re-insertion of second year forward, Kwame McIntosh into the starting lineup.  Since returning to the starting five, Kwame has added up 38 points (including a career high 25 points tonight) while shooting 14/33 and 5/8 from deep while compiling 17 rebounds.<br />
Not only has this change to the starting lineup turned things around for the Bluejays and Coach McConnell, the increased usage of redshirt freshman Milt Bray.  The combo guard who has been splitting reps between the 2 and 3 positions this season, has shot an impressive 23/52 from the field and is currently shooting at a 33% from beyond the arc since becoming a starter.<br />
Looking to avoid the 2nd straight relegation in his 2nd year of holding the reins at Elmhurst, Coach McConnell has to be pleased with the current upturn in play from his Bluejays including the recent uptick in production from senior big man, Johnnie Travis, who is currently sitting at a 57.8% eFGP on the season thanks to his bully ball style of play. Can the Blue Birds keep this up and avoid relegation? We shall see.<br /><br /><br />
