Mar 20 2042:  <b>Rough Start for Juwanna</b> - <i>by JuwannaMann on December 9th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Juwanna Mann's tenure in Kingsville got off to a rough start as the president was MIA following the press conference announcing her hiring. When confronted by the South Texan about her whereabouts, Mann revealed she had "forgotten her password to the building". The South Texan had no further questions. <br /><br /><br />

Apr 03 2017:  <b>A Farewell to Ben Latham</b> - <i>by Bluebirds21 on February 11th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville Javelinas bid farewell to program legend Ben Latham today. Despite only playing in 97 games over 2 official seasons, Latham leaves his mark on the Javelinas record books. He finishes his career as the all time PPG leader for Kingsville, at 22.1 PPG, as well as finishing 4th all time in career points. He also finishes 5th all time in career rebounds and 6th all time in career blocks. Latham punctuated his Javelinas career with his 2nd consecutive conference player of the year award, just days after leading the Javelinas to their first ever Elite 8 appearance. He graduates Summa cum laude in civil engineering and plans to stay home in Kingsville. He will be missed.  <br /><br /><br />

Apr 03 2017:  <b>Javelinas Bid Farewell to Program Star Ben Latham</b> - <i>by Bluebirds21 on February 11th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
Ben Latham played in 97 career games with the Javelinas, but his impact will forever be felt on the program. A 2 star recruit coming out of junior college, Latham did not have many suitors. Head coach Eli Sloan saw one workout and knew he had his star center of the future. "He was dominant, raw but dominant. I could tell he had star potential." Latham redshirted his first year in an effort to take his game to the next level. The next 2 seasons saw Latham dominate night in and night out. The 2016 season saw the Javelinas finish 4th in conference with a 26-18 overall record, a 25 game improvement from the previous seasons 1-40 record.  The Javelinas came into the 2017 season hungry for more. They faced a tough non-conference schedule, but knocked off numerous D2 programs. Conference play saw them compile a 23-7 record, winning the conference for the first time in program history. They went on to claim the programs second conference tournament title. In the D3 national tournament, Latham carried the Javelinas to the elite 8, the first time the program had made it past the round of 32. Latham leaves the Javelinas with numerous notable achievements, including:<br />
Back to back conference player of the year<br />
Back to back all conference team<br />
4th all time in scoring - 2141 points in 2 seasons<br />
5th all time in rebounds - 1126 in 2 seasons<br />
6th all time in blocks<br />
2nd all time in POTG awards - 48 over 2 seasons<br />
<br />
Latham graduates summa cum laude with a perfect 4.0 GPA in civil engineering. He looks to continue his career working on improving the infrastructure of the surrounding Kingsville area.<br />

Mar 04 2017:  <b>Javelinas Win Conference for First Time</b> - <i>by Bluebirds21 on February 1st, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The Texas A&amp;M Kingsville Javelinas claimed their first conference title in program history today, with an 85-69 win over conference dweller, Wheelock. RS SR center Ben Latham was his usual dominant self, posting 26 points, 17 rebounds and 2 blocks in 35 minutes of play earning his 17th player of the game in the process. When asked about the accomplishment, Latham remarked "It's cool to be a part of history for this program, but regular season titles is not what I am after. I want to win the conference tourney and make some noise in the national tourney!" Latham is likely the conference MVP after leading the conference in both points and rebounds, and finishing 2nd in +/-, only trailing teammate Matthew McGrath. The Javelinas host 16 seed Drew tomorrow in the first round of the conference playoffs. <br /><br /><br />
