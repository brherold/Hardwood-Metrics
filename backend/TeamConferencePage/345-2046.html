Mar 20 2038:  <b>Colonels Squander Lead, Fall in Heartbreaking Fashion</b> - <i>by EmeraldSeasSunshine on April 28th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
The Colonels played well in the 2nd round of the D-III Tournament, but began to show signs of fatigue late. Down to the wire it went - Mathis hit 1 of 2 to tie it at 52, and then on the ensuing possession Jerome hit 1 of 2 from the strike to reclaim the lead, 53-52. Then, as the final seconds ticked down, Parham brought it up the court, hit Mueller on a dime and as time expired his shot swished through the fateful net. Devastating. 55-53.<br />
<br />
Senior Kendrick Jones after the game, "What can you do? We did everything right, but caught a cold late and Mueller hits that incredible shot. I'm hurt, last game I'll play in the the red and gray. However, I could not have asked for a better way to go out then guns a blazing in the Tournament. I am forever a Colonel. And to those who watched us tonight, this is just the beginning for Shipp at Nicholls. This team is set up to become the real deal for years to come. Don't sleep on them. Goodbye Colonel nation, hope to see you at the reunion." And with that, the Jones era is officially over. On to 2039.<br /><br /><br />

Oct 28 2037:  <b>Programs Problems Highlighted by Latest Scandal</b> - <i>by EmeraldSeasSunshine on March 17th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Unfortunate news has come to light tonight. Messages from Assistant Coach Ethan Cook to recruit Robert Jewell have been exposed to the media. In multiple messages, Cook threatened Jewell to come to Nicholls State or he would release his entire families information to the public, including his pet hamster Hammy.<br />
<br />
There's more. Over suspicion of Cook potentially having access to this type of information, his phone was checked by police. There disturbing images, including the names of all of Jewell's family members and unspeakable plans to get him and Hammy to come to the University of Nicholls State, were revealed.<br />
<br />
As of 11:48 PM, Ethan Cook has been arrested for conspiracy and has been promptly fired by the University. Simon Hart is set to fill the role temporarily while the Colonels seek to recover from yet another set back.<br />

Mar 13 2037:  <b>Nicholls Has A Chance...</b> - <i>by EmeraldSeasSunshine on February 28th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Times have been rough for the Colonels, but tomorrow they can rewrite the narrative with a win over one of the best teams in the Country in Corpus Christi... And they have a legit chance.<br />
<br />
Out of all the teams in this conference, over the past two seasons, the Colonels defense has been arguably the best matchup for the electric offense of the Islanders. They have the size, the speed, and the tenacity to achieve the impossible. It'll be about heart, as the Colonels look to put together one of the greatest defensive efforts in history.<br />
<br />
Win or Lose, The Colonels vow to fight together<br /><br /><br />

Mar 08 2036:  <b>Apology to Bridgeport</b> - <i>by EmeraldSeasSunshine on January 4th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
<i>Smokes</i>: Next year we will RESTORE OUR RIVALRY WITH THOSE PESKY KNIGHTS! Oh, what's that? I'm supposed to APOLOGIZE? Well, in that case, I'd like to extend a heartfelt apology to President Base and the Bridgeport fans, we didn't realize how much damage we caused by leaving for a flaky rival. We will do better in the future because WE FROM THE SOUTH BABYYYYY! AND WE GOTTA SHOW THAT SOUTHERN LOVE TO OUR OPPONENTS. PEACE OUT AND MERRY... OH WAIT IT'S MARCH. WE'LL SEE Y'ALL IN OCTOBER PESK... I MEAN BEAUTIFUL SHINY KNIGHTS! MAKE SURE YOU HEARD IT RIGHT PEOPLE, THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL SHINY KNIGHTS!<br /><br /><br />

Mar 11 2035:  <b>Hardwood&#39;s Ruling</b> - <i>by EmeraldSeasSunshine on November 10th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Jay Coleman, who was technically fired, has been forcefully reinstated. After examining the case, Big Hardwood has determined that it's a violation to promote an Assistant Coach without 2 seasons under his belt. Therefore, Coleman must stick around for the 2036 Season.<br />
<br />
There's more. Allegedly, Jay Coleman helped devised the gameplan for the First Round of the Conference Tournament, already knowing he was to return. Given how tough the Colonels played, President <i>Smokes</i>, while dressed in his G.O.A.T Halloween costume, addressed Coleman about a potential proposition following the game. <i>You win 20+ games, and finish top-8, you stay another year</i>. Coleman has since accepted that offer.<br />
<br />
It'll be interesting to see how this young team responds to all this turmoil, while demoting to the depths of D-III Basketball. Will they rise from the ashes to reclaim their glory? Or will they continue to crumble until there is nothing left? Talk is cheap, action is everything. Coleman has learned that lesson.<br />
