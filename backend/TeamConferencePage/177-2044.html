Apr 06 2026:  <b>Put with the old in with the new</b> - <i>by Mhabliston on June 30th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
Thad Hodge is out. His drunken antics were enough for the staff at CSU. He berated staff and students alike. A new captain has been called upon, our very own Coach Mathis. The young coach is ready to take on the lead and is excited to lead this team to new heights. “I’ve been sober for 12 years and the next drink I’ll ever have is after a national championship with an Odell's” said the coach.<br />
Thad was a liability, he hated recruiting, never appreciated the staff, and would drink on the court. It’s time for new ships to sail. Here’s to the future of the buccaneers <br /><br /><br />

Nov 12 2025:  <b>Thad&#39;s Trouble Off the Court</b> - <i>by Mhabliston on May 18th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
9 News recently released a video provided by the Charleston Count Police department showing Coach Thad Hodge allegedly failing a roadside DUI test after leaving a local bar. A beer bottle can be seen falling on the ground as he exits his vehicle. As of right now CSU's president has not released any statement on the matter.<br />
It is believed that Coach Hodge was celebrating the teams win against rivals Lebanon Valley and was spotted with their head coach at the bar known as the "Hairy Beaver".<br />
As of now no action has been taken against Coach Hodge, however penalties will likely ensue in the coming days.<br />

Jan 18 2025:  <b>Buccaneers Hire a New Captain.</b> - <i>by Mhabliston on April 13th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
On Jan. 9th the Charleston Southern Buccaneers decided to part ways with long-term Coach Guy Berry. When asked about the decision Berry stated " I appreciate my time here at CS, I was able to help these young men grow and perform at an elite level. But all good things come to an end and over the last few years, I wasn't able to reach the goals I set for this team. It's time for me to move on and I wish only the best for Coach Hodge and these young men."<br />
Tad Hodge is now taking over command for the Buccaneers. The waters have been rough all season but he hopes to steer the boat into clearer skies the rest of the season.<br />
"Many people think I may be too brash but my motto is ' No pussy-footing around' and that goes for everyone here at Charleston Southern, including my staff. If someone doesn't want to give it their all then they are free to leave." says Coach Hodge. Coach Hodge was brought in by new President Mhabliston, who had this to say about his new coach. " Thad is the type of guy that you despise until he is on your side. He has coached at every level and does not let up. I recall the first time I met him, we were both in college coaching  5th graders at a regional tournament. His team consistently won by 43 points, and when up he never sat his starters. This continued thoughout his career. He doesn't show mercy. That is the change we need here at Charleston Southern. It will take some time but I have faith that Coach Hodge will get us back to the promise land."<br />
<br />
Since taking over the Buccaneer's are 1-2, losing both by a margin of 18 points and winning by only 5 points. Hodge has his plate full, lets see if he will float or sink. <br /><br /><br />
