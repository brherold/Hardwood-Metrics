Oct 03 2030:  <b>A Rebuilding Year</b> - <i>by mjreichard on February 12th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
The Tar Heels are in a rebuilding process heading into the season after the graduation of 4 starters. With 4-year starter Bob Kaiser heading to the NBA (signed as an UFA with the Chicago Bulls), 3-year starters Jonathan Taylor and Keith Harding and 2-year starter Bob Carver graduating, lots of experience has walked out the door.<br />
<br />
The team will center around All-Conference center Leroy Harris, the only returning starter. He will anchor a starting unit with a Sophomore backcourt of Terrance Beasley and James Hurst, who are both combo guards. The frontcourt starters alongside Harris will be Senior big Matthew Geiger and Freshman phenom Otis Logan. Senior Gary Fisher will be the 6th man and Freshman Zach Grun and Mark Collins getting backcourt minutes and Freshman Grady Collier getting frontcourt minutes.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of young players with little experience that will see the floor this year for the Tar Heels. This may be a tough season but should build a solid foundation for the future of the program. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_2840'></a>
Oct 05 2028:  <b>A Fresh Start! </b> - <i>by mjreichard on October 22nd, 2022</i> <br /><br />
After 8 seasons with mixed results the Tar Heels moved on from Coach CC Nagle and brought over Tad Gulley from Central Michigan.<br />
<br />
We want to thank Coach Nagle for his 5 seasons as the Lead Assistant Coach and 8 years as the Head Coach. He led the team to an appearance in the Elight Eight and 2 30-win seasons. We wish Coach Nagle luck as he continues his coaching career.<br />
<br />
New Head Coach Gulley was an Assistant Coach at Bethany Lutheran and Jacksonville State before taking the Head Coach job at Central Michigan. In just 4 seasons he led the team 2 Regular Season Conference Championships, 1 Conference Tournament Championship and an NCAA Tournament appearance.<br />
<br />
He brings a strong offensive mindset, teaching ability, recruiting touch and motivational approach to the program. Alongside of defensive guru Assistant Coach Les McQueen, offensive specialist Assistant Coach Dan Paul and Bench Coach Jeremy Robinson, the Tar Heels look to turn the program back around this season.  <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_399'></a>
Oct 08 2009:  <b>Congrats Lou Dillard! </b> - <i>by mjreichard on November 23rd, 2019</i> <br /><br />
After 4 amazing seasons in Chapel Hill, including 2 All-Conference and 1 All-America team selection, Lou Dillard was taken by the San Antonio Spurs with the #7 overall pick in the NBA Draft! Good luck in San Antonio Lou! <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_391'></a>
Mar 21 2009:  <b>Season Review 2009</b> - <i>by mjreichard on November 18th, 2019</i> <br /><br />
The Tar Heels had to create a new identity this year after their best player in team history, Daniel Richmond, graduated and moved on to the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA. In his absence, new players had to step up to the plate in a new Conference with tougher competition.<br />
<br />
The team had its ups and downs, fighting to a 15-15 record in Conference, but came together at just the right time. Entering the Conference Tournament at the 7th seed, the Tar Heels caught fire and ran the table, winning the Conference Tournament Championship. This hot streak took them into the NCAA Tournament, where as a #16 seed they knocked off the #1 seed Simpson Storm, before losing in the Round of 32 to a strong Tarleton State squad.<br />
<br />
The Tar Heels big man, Senior Lou Dillard, led the way with 17.6 PPG, 12.0 RPG and 1.8 BPG and will surely win some post season awards on his way to the NBA Draft. Junior PG Lee Livingston took the leap this year averaging 17.4 PPG and 9.2 APG and putting himself in the conversation for the top PG in the Conference.<br />
<br />
With several 4 Star Freshman on this year's team and 3 more coming next year the Tar Heels are looking to build on a strong close to this season.  <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_102'></a>
Oct 02 2003:  <b>The End of an Era</b> - <i>by mjreichard on December 21st, 2018</i> <br /><br />
The Tar Heels are in for big changes next season as their core group moves on. UNC has had an amazing three year run led by a group of players who have all graduated. Trevor Waters, the team leader and #2 pick in the NBA Draft by Miami, called his time in Chapel Hill “the best years of my life”. Waters, along with All-Conference big man Malik Thompson and Seniors Jerry Sims, Dick Dozier and Dillon Fraser started the whole season together and Ruben McGowen, also a Senior, was their star off of the bench. The top six players on the Tar Heels now move on.<br />
<br />
There is excitement for Junior big man Mike Ash and Freshman Chet Chappell to lead this new look team with Senior swing man Trevor Walker. Five star recruit Harvey Ward also joins them this season. It may be a rebuilding year for the team, but there are pieces here to continue to compete with the best programs in the country. <br /><br /><br />
