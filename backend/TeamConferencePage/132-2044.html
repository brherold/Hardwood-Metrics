Nov 19 2036:  <b>The Seawolves Get Their Guy! Rodrick Krueger! </b> - <i>by TimberCreekCrew on January 26th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
In his four years at Bishop Eustace Prep School in Pennsauken, New Jersey, Rodrick Krueger showcased impressive skills on the basketball court. He has incredible size for a High School Senior standing 7'2" and weighing 260 lbs., Rodrick's physical attributes, including a wingspan of 7'7" and a vertical leap of 28 inches! In his senior year, he averaged 11.5 points, 10 rebounds, and 2.7 blocks per game, finishing his high school career with a solid performance.<br />
<br />
While it is more than likely he will need a Redshirt year to meet his full potential at Stony Brook, he should be the centerpiece of the program for the next 4-5 years.<br />
<br />
When asked about the commitment Head Coach Rufus Person only said, "Can't teach height" while walking away with a 7'2'' cardboard cutout of his prized recruit, and an even bigger smile on his face! <br /><br /><br />

Apr 03 2034:  <b>Seawolves crowned as Division 2 National Champions!</b> - <i>by TimberCreekCrew on September 21st, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Stony Brook, NY - In a season filled with ups and downs, the Stony Brook University basketball team achieved the pinnacle of success by clinching the Division 2 National Championship, after reaching the Division 3 National Title game just last season. Their remarkable journey included nail-biting victories and standout performances, leaving fans and Alumni in awe.<br />
<br />
The Seawolves, led by Head Coach Rufus Person (14th year as SBU's Head Coach, and 20th year with the program), finished the season with a fantastic 35-12 record, a testament to their work ethic and skill. In the fiercely competitive Division 2 - V.6 conference, Stony Brook stood tall, securing a conference record of 22-8. Despite being named Co-Conference Champions, they were edged out of the top spot due to a tiebreaker.<br />
<br />
However, the real magic happened on the national stage. The team was seeded 6th in the National Tournament but defied the odds, going undefeated with a perfect 6-0 record to claim the Division 2 National Championship.<br />
The journey to glory was paved with standout victories, but none more exhilarating than the National Championship Game itself. Facing off against Jackson State, the Seawolves emerged triumphant in a thrilling showdown, winning 80-91. Jim O'Hara, a senior guard and normally, the team's sixth man, was named the player of the game in this historic clash. O’Hara said goodbye to the Seawolves fans in historic fashion by scoring 30 points in his final game! As coach Person says, with the championship net around his neck and arm around the stand out Senior, “Jimmy came in small and underdeveloped. He always grinded while leading the scout team the past three season and today all of his hard work and determination has paid off. He will go down in the history books of our program! Every Championship team needs a Jimmy!”<br />
<br />
Another unforgettable moment came in the Sweet 16, where Stony Brook clashed with the top-seeded University of Louisiana-Lafayette. The Seawolves displayed their mettle once again, prevailing 100-91.<br />
<br />
In the Final Four, Stony Brook went head-to-head with the favorite to win the Championship, Ball State University. In a spectacular performance, they emerged victorious with an 85-72 score line, punching their ticket to the title game.<br />
The success of the Seawolves was propelled by their exceptional players. Jim O'Hara led the charge with an impressive season average of 15.5 points per game, 4.8 assists, 2.5 rebounds, and 1.1 steals. His outstanding contributions earned him the title of player of the game in the national championship showdown.<br />
<br />
Reginald Joyner, a sophomore shooting guard, showcased his skills with an average of 15.2 points per game and 1.6 steals. Hank Ray, a junior small forward, impressed with his sharpshooting, boasting a 41% three-point shooting rate and averaging 14.3 points per game and 4.3 rebounds.<br />
<br />
Ryan Fogarty, a red-shirt senior power forward, left an indelible mark with his remarkable season performance, averaging 14.1 points, an astounding 12.8 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 1.6 blocks per game. Fogarty was a consistent force on the court, earning 14 player of the game awards throughout the season, capping off a legendary career at Stony Brook University.<br />
<br />
Key contributors like Randall Holt, Devin Blakely, Carmelo Ojeda, and Stuart Helm played pivotal roles in Stony Brook's journey to greatness.<br />
<br />
This season will forever be etched in the archives of Stony Brook University's basketball history as the Seawolves defied expectations and emerged as the Division 2 National Champions, just one season after earning promotion from Division 3. Their remarkable journey is a testament to the spirit of perseverance and teamwork that defines college basketball at its best. Congratulations to the Stony Brook University basketball team on their outstanding achievement! (Cue One Shining Moment!)<br /><br /><br />
