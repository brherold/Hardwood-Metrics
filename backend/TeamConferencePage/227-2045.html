Oct 17 2015:  <b>Sycamore Legend Donny Boyles Retires</b> - <i>by ECL2002 on October 28th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
He was "just a kid from Columbus" when he showed up in Terre Haute in 2005, he would soon end up much more than that, averaging almost 13 points and 8 rebounds a game as a true freshman. This would lead him to earn the honor of Conference Freshman Of The Year during the 2005-2006 season. He would go on to earn 3 consecutive All-Conference honors and even earn a bid to the Division II Tournament during his sophomore season in 2007. In 2009, Boyles was selected as the 59th pick in the NBA Draft and became the first Sycamore to be drafted and the first to play in the NBA. He was inducted into the Indiana State Basketball Hall Of Fame in 2011 and saw his number 32 raised into the rafters of the Hulman Center.<br />
<br />
On Tuesday afternoon, Boyles took to Twitter to officially announce his retirement, he said "I am thankful for everything that has happened the last 28 years of my life, from Coach Hawkins (Columbus High School) to Coach Sparks (Indiana State) to Coach McMillan (Indiana Pacers) to my lovely wife, my two beautiful children, my mom, my dad, my brother, my friends, family, and everyone else who supported me along the way. With that being said it is the end of the road in my basketball career, but I look forward to spending more time at home with my wife and kids." Boyles played 6 seasons in the NBA and scored a total of 3,907 points, racked up 2,033 rebounds, and 436 blocks. He shot 52.2 percent from the field and 35.1 percent from three-point range. That is pretty special for someone who was "Just a kid from Columbus" if you ask me. <br /><br /><br />

Oct 26 2011:  <b>Donny Boyles Inducted into the ISU Hall of Fame </b> - <i>by ECL2002 on March 21st, 2020</i> <br /><br />
This Saturday former Indiana State star center Donny Boyles was the first player inducted into the ISU Basketball Hall of Fame at halftime of the Sycamores game against the Division 3 Trinity Bantums. Boyles is ISU’s all time leader in career points, rebounds, and blocks with 2,591 points, 1,470 rebounds, and 219 blocks. Boyles also holds the record for highest single season FG % with 63.7% during his junior season in 2008. He holds the record for career FG % as well with a career 61.5 FG % and that’s not it he also is the leader in career FG made with 1,037 over his four years in Terre Haute. Boyles has gone on to the the NBA with the Indiana Pacers after being drafted as the 59th pick in the 2009 pro draft and is currently in his third season where he has averaged 8.3 ppg , 4.4 rpg, 1 bpg to this point in his professional career.<br />

Oct 11 2011:  <b>Coaching Change</b> - <i>by ECL2002 on March 16th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
After not leading the Sycamores to the National Tournament the last 4 seasons we decided it was best for the program that we move on from Coach Sparks. It was a very successful run in Terre Haute for Coach Sparks racking up a total of 232 wins over the course of nine seasons as well as a Division 2 tournament appearance. With all that being said we would like to welcome our new head coach of the Indiana State Sycamores basketball team, Jack Wise. Coach Wise is making the move from the Division 2 Castleton Spartans with a history of developing young players into stars and landing big time recruits which we feel will take our program to the next level.<br /><br /><br />
