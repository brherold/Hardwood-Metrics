Oct 07 2038:  <b>2039 Ferrum Panthers Team Photo</b> - <i>by AbeFroman on May 6th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/1aC4TBE" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/1aC4TBE</a><br />
Please welcome your 2039 Ferrum Panthers! The best claymation team in the nation! Expect a big season from Jimmy “Timber” Shaw, who averaged a double-double last year, and returning starting PG Loren “Cuber” Poole who surprised the conference with very strong play as a sophomore. Also watch for 6th man true freshman Andy “Spring” Coyle who was heavily recruited by a number of teams before deciding to join the Panthers.<br /><br /><br />

Nov 07 2035:  <b>Conference IV.7 Preview, part 8 - Penn State/Luther</b> - <i>by AbeFroman on November 29th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
#15 Penn State - PSU escaped demotion last year with a .500 record, but they are unlikely to sneak by again this year. Like Cedarville, they have a bright future with 5-star sophomore Elwood Burgess and two 4-star players, sophomores Fabian Esquivel and Darren Morelli, but this year will be challenging for these guys. Don't be surprised to see this team back in IV.7 in 2038 as contenders, though.<br />
<br />
#16 Luther - As we all learned in Ted Lasso, the most common result for promoted teams is demotion the next season. Unfortunately for Luther that looks very likely the case. SG Tevin Christy and C Norm Barber return as seniors and will try to rally their teammates around them, but it's going to be a long season for a team that just doesn't have the height and strength to compete in D1 this season. It will be a time of rebuilding as the Norse have 3 redshirt freshmen and 4 true freshmen scholarship players on the team.<br />

Nov 03 2035:  <b>Conference IV.7 Preview, part 7 - Lee/Cedarville</b> - <i>by AbeFroman on November 28th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
#13 Lee - The Flames placed 5th last season in IV.7 but graduated two impactful seniors and saw the departure of their president after only 1 season. The team is a bit rudderless heading into the season, which is a disappointing situation for junior PG Johnny Steiner, who is one of the best underclassmen in the conference. If Steiner and fellow speedster SG Clark D’Ignoti can stay healthy, knock down their shots, and get steals, Lee has a shot to stay in D1, but without a president guiding the team strategy, I wouldn't bet on it. [editor’s note: Lee hired a president after I wrote this. Welcome BillMurray]<br />
<br />
#14 Cedarville - President El Jefe is no stranger to winning, but Cedarville struggled last year and unfortunately looks poised to continue their slide down to D2. The bright side is the Yellow Jackets are a young team, sporting two 4 star freshmen coming off a redshirt season. The upside potential of Paul Shepherd and John Schiller is huge and we can expect them to be a menace next year, whether that's in D2 or, if El Jefe's got some tricks up his sleeve, maybe in D1.<br /><br /><br />
