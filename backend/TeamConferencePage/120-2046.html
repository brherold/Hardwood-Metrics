Jan 14 2044:  <b>Staying Fresh; Sweet Revenge Highlight Second Half Focus</b> - <i>by SickningSaffire on March 9th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
<i></i>As we reach the halfway point of Conference Play, Tulane sits in 7th place with a 10-5 record, just 1 game out of 2nd. Aware of the tough grind the team has been on, Head Coach Matt Greco has decided to give the guys some extra time off to reset their minds and freshen up physically before the second half.<br />
<br />
While the players are off, the coaching staff plans to be in the film room, dedicating their time to clean up any areas of concern and plug defensive holes. Here's what Head Coach Matt Greco had to say on the recent developments: "You know its been an up and down season, and taking some time to reflect it's becoming clear where our issues lie. A couple minor tweaks here and there will really help this team excel moving forward, and I think with the boys getting extended rest, they will be ready to execute come Saturday."<br />
<br />
The Wave will kick off the second half of the season at Home (where the have yet to lose), looking to return the favor to Monmouth, who handily won 89-64 in the first meeting. With a week of new findings, the coaching staff is expecting not just signs of growth from the team, but necessary improvements to spark a momentous next 15 games.<br />
<br />
The revenge tour, and the Road To March, starts now!<br />

Dec 19 2043:  <b>&quot;No Moral Victories&quot; As Road Struggles Continue</b> - <i>by SickningSaffire on March 2nd, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Tulane's latest loss to Rider moves them to just 4-5 on the road, and marks their 4th road loss decided by 5 points or less on the season. Despite the close games, the message from Assistant Coach Alex Ruby holds strong, "There are no moral victories when you get to March. Each loss is a hit to the 'ole RPI. Let's not sugarcoat it either, we've had leads in almost all of these games, we have to do better at closing them out. Vegas bettors may be happy, we cover the spread or whatever, but I'm not here... I mean we're not here to play for Vegas, we're here to win <b>BIG</b> games and make the tournament. We'll  get together to find new ways to go <b>BIG</b> or go <b>HOME</b>."<br />
<br />
The Wave hope to respond in a <b>BIG</b> way against first-place Arizona State on Christmas Eve, though it will be a <b>TALL</b> task.<br />

Mar 15 2043:  <b>Wave Make The D-III Tournament</b> - <i>by SickningSaffire on January 31st, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Tulane clinched a berth in the 2043 Division 3 Tournament today with a convincing 80-57 Victory over San Jose State. They will enter the Tourney as an 11-Seed in the South Region and will face 6-Seed Augusta tomorrow.<br />
<br />
We caught up with Coach Greco before the key matchup, "Augusta is a tough team. I mean you look at their record, it isn't easy to string together 37 wins at any level. It also isn't easy to dominate your conference tournament. We come off a 5-Game Win Streak, and a Conference Tourney Championship, they come off a loss. We need to feed on the momentum we've built and keep playing an elevated brand of basketball. And I believe we can!"<br />
<br />
This will be the First Appearance in the Tournament since Greco took over, and the first in 5 years. The Wave are hungry to make noise here in 2043 and carry the Program's momentum into 2044. GO GREEN WAVE!<br />

Mar 13 2043:  <b>Tulane Looking To Make The Tournament, As Injury Concerns Loom</b> - <i>by SickningSaffire on January 29th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
The Wave have been making great strides on the court, winning 11 out of their last 13 contests. A win over (IN) Arkansas State, almost certainly puts Tulane on the right side of the bubble. Unfortunately, they'll be down 3 players, including starting Forward Brent Turley, who is out with forearm inflammation.<br />
<br />
We spoke with Assistant Alex Ruby about the matter. Here's what he had to say, "Yeah, yeah! It's not a great situation Kerry, but just like in Vegas we put the chips we have to play and look to win big. That's been the emphasis all week: <b>LETS WIN BIG!</b> If you seek to win big, when you fall short you'll still have good odds to emerge with a win. That's how I interpret it anyways. Coach Matt's been living by a certain phrase all year, don't know if I like it as much as my analogy, but this is what he says: <i>Win gritty, not pretty</i>. The idea is that the team with more fight wins the war. It's locker room talk, you know, something to keep 'em up when they're shooting bricks. I think I've said too much. We'll be ready tomorrow, that's what matters Kerry. See you around."<br />
<br />
Coach Ruby's words offer an interesting insight into  each coaches approach on gameday. One looks at the <b>BIG</b> picture, the other focused on the details. Together, it is one heck of a force to be reckoned with. Make sure to tune into tomorrow's game Wave fans, it'll be a doozy!<br />

Jan 29 2043:  <b>New Defensive System, Looks; Fresh Kicks</b> - <i>by SickningSaffire on January 16th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
The Wave have implemented a new and improved defensive system, sure to frustrate any opponent that dares to enter Devlin Fieldhouse. There have been offensive changes too that will show up in a big way against Hawai'i.<br />
<br />
The Wave are rolling in.<br />
<br />
I'm Kerry Chantaneer, your new girl for all things Green Wave. Redemption season starts now. <br /><br /><br />
