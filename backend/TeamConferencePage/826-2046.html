Jan 19 2045:  <b>Prevailing mood</b> - <i>by sparky on May 7th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Anthropologists have noted a curious recent development among the North Adams people of western Massachusetts, in which a communal pile of stones and rocks has shown up in front of the Amsler Center, home of the MCLA basketball team, losers of their last 40 or so games. The prevailing hypothesis at this time is that the pile serves some type of function in an impending ritual. A banner in front of the pile contains a series of markings that many have opined is in fact some type of proto-language shared among the people of this remote enclave. It reads Հաշվեհարդարի օր.<br />
<br />
In other news, the biology department at MCLA has successfully created a clone of former MLB pitcher Nolan Ryan. <br /><br /><br />

Dec 31 2043:  <b>Baby&#39;s first game</b> - <i>by sparky on March 5th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Olga Chevinova, the girlfriend of MCLA freshman C Seth Johns, decided to take her new baby, Jermaine McLean, to his very first basketball game. The two week old, and yet already 6' 8½" McLean, who has committed to play for MCLA next year, was startled to hear the torrent of boos filling up the arena as the home squad fell behind early against Rockhurst. He kicked, screamed, and nearly got MCLA T'd up when he threw his bottle on the court. His gymnosophist mother was no match for the child's rage, and one can only wonder what might have happened had MCLA not gotten their act together and finally grabbed the lead with 3:00 in the first half. Among those most affected by this squalid scene was Cocoon Boy Moran, who noted that "the child's demonic countenance spurred me to create scoring opportunities for my teammates, lest we lose the game and incur the unimaginably horrible wrath of his vile temper!"<br /><br /><br />

Dec 19 2043:  <b>we will we will rock you</b> - <i>by sparky on March 2nd, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Three of Hardwoods most well known presidents made the long and treacherous trip to North Adams, bringing with them gifts of gold, frankincense, and recruiting contacts for the new savior of MCLA basketball, Jermaine "The Pain" McLean. The prospect, who came forth from the womb of world renown gymnosophist Olga Chevinova, and in miraculous turn of events not only grew to 6'8" before even getting out of the nursery, but also somehow qualified academically, is the biggest get in MCLA history, way bigger than current so called stars Cocoon Boy Moran and little Torey Lewis. Are you kidding me, this guy is the real deal! As soon as he finished delivering this baby, Head Coach Clint Cherry threw open the delivery room window and screamed into the night "MCLA IS NOW UNSTOPPABLE!!! HAHAHAHAHAH THERE IS A NEW TOTAL DOMINATING FRANCHISE SLASH PROGRAM TYPE THING COMING DOWN THE PIKE!!!! <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4189'></a>
Oct 21 2043:  <b>omg</b> - <i>by sparky on February 14th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Tragedy nearly struck the MCLA basketball team today as their flight to Walla Walla came THIS close to crashing. As the chartered 737 Lockheed 5Xa twin powered combustion prop plane approached Walla Walla, the town's thick and unrelenting smog of filth and airborne slime began to pose a serious threat to all on board. The plane began to go this way and that way, and then up and down, and everybody started freaking out. Even to the aircraft's seasoned pilot, Captain Ryland Gooddorf, owner of bronze and silver stars from 16 different wars, the odds of catastrophe were too great, and he began crying like a mid-sized infant pulled from his mother's bosom.  The plane was pitched downward, racing directly to its doom, when backup PF Eric Vogel, who later revealed he used to "be really into playing FlightSimulator," raced to the cockpit and steadied the bird, before gently crashlanding it in nearby Pasco. <br /><br /><br />

Dec 04 2042:  <b>December 5th, 2042, Manhattan</b> - <i>by sparky on January 1st, 2025</i> <br /><br />
<i>Dearest MeeMaw,<br />
Yesterday was a most trying day for your dear grandson. The team, in an evocation of the most extreme listlessness, managed to lose to Pace by an unconscionable 58 points. Thereafter, in the locker room, my duty was to deliver a fiery excoriation so extreme in pitch, that I incurred a bloody nose! You would think such a display would galvanize the lads (aside from Cockrell, naturally), and it did, albeit it only temporarily. For one of the new recruits has brought along with him a woman of the gymnosophist variety, and she brings with her a capacity to meddle. Instead of rebuking the players for such a degrading humiliation, she has praised them for enduring it, claiming the ordeal was "a pious cleansing of the ego." Sadly, she is of such a feminine bearing that her words have great sway over them, and I worry that this will have a terrible affect on them moving forward.<br />
Lovingly,<br />
D'Angelo</i><br /><br /><br />
