Mar 31 2042:  <b>(Almost) Perfection</b> - <i>by OjolDriver on December 12th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
So, these are the things that this season's Moravian team managed to achieve:<br />
#1 TPI in D3<br />
#1 RPI in D3<br />
#1 PD in the nation (+34 overall, +38 in tourney)<br />
Double championships<br />
<br />
All these are accomplished by a bunch of homegrown, in-region players with no superstar among them (zero 4 or 5* player).<br />
<br />
Special shout out to our graduating seniors. The first recruiting class of this current management has finally brought Moravian to the promised land.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4071'></a>
Nov 16 2041:  <b>Expectations still high, kind of</b> - <i>by OjolDriver on November 3rd, 2024</i> <br /><br />
"So, Coach, what is your expectation for this season's team?" asked the reporter from the Comenian.  "We are definitely going to promote." replied the coach confidently.  "But you said similar thing last season, Coach, and we're still at D3 now."  "This year will be different", replied Coach R, "We are at full strength now. Look at our non-con record."<br />
<br />
"How about you, President Ojoldriver?" asked the reporter, noticing the President standing near the back of the room, "Do you share the confidence of Coach R?"  "Well, I'm pretty optimistic." replied the President. "Are you sure?  When you were hired, you promised to return Moravian to D1 in 6 seasons.  We're behind schedule now."<br />
<br />
The President glowered at the reporter for a few seconds, then replied, "Remember, in Moravian, if something doesn't go according to the plan, it's always the coaches' fault.", before abruptly stalking out of the room.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4014'></a>
Oct 11 2040:  <b>Expectations are running high - promote or die!</b> - <i>by OjolDriver on August 28th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
"Well coach Robertson, what's your expectation for the team this season?", asked the journalist from the Moravian Comenian.<br />
<br />
"This is the season we're going back to our winning way.  All the players from the old system are gone, and my handpicked boys are ready to make some noise. All the pieces are in place, and promotion is definitely within our reach", replied Coach Robertson excitedly.<br />
<br />
"But Coach, it seems that the program did not make any significant stride during your 4 years here.  What makes you so sure this is the season the program will turn it around?"<br />
<br />
"No no no, you don't understand.  Don't look only at the record.  There is a grand strategy behind all my moves that you laymen don't understand," replied the agitated coach, "Let me say a message to the whole Moravian fanbase.  This is the season when you will stop being the butt of the joke in the Hardwood community.  Keep your hope up!"<br />
<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3777'></a>
Feb 14 2037:  <b>Moravian Introduces Its Latest Class</b> - <i>by OjolDriver on February 21st, 2024</i> <br /><br />
"I'm happy to announce that our recruiting is finally complete," said a beaming Coach Robertson. "Shell and Cole will be our future stars, while Sales and Florence will be solid contributors. Yes, all of them are still pretty raw, but we will let them play as much as they can. These kids are, without doubt, one of the best class to arrive in Bethlehem lately."<br />
<br />
When reminded that the Greyhounds has actually landed 5* and 4* recruits just recently, the coach get a little bit flustered and replied, "Well, basketball is a team sports. Remember that, TEAM sports. You can recruit the best player in the nation, but if you surround him with stiffs and scrubs, it's just a waste of talents. Look at the team's records with those so-called superstars. This is a very good class. Don't you dare questioning that." And with that, Coach Robertson stormed out of the press room.<br />
<br /><br /><br />

Oct 02 2036:  <b>New President, The Real Savior, or Another Crazy Failure?</b> - <i>by OjolDriver on January 13th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
"Hello there, Greyhounds fans.  Yes, I'm supposed to be the one that will guide your team back to relevance, after years of gross mismanagement that's borderline criminal," said Moravian's new president OjolDriver in his first press conference.<br />
<br />
"Yes, we have a grand strategy, detailed five year plan, bla bla bla.  But make no mistake, our team will still be bad for a while.  In fact, I projected we will only be back to Division 1 by 2043."<br />
<br />
"What's that?  You ask why so long?  Dude, your team sucks real bad", said the president irritably.  "I mean, your team marched steadily from D1 to D3.  How much worse can it get?  Suck it up and stop being crybabies.  What's 5 or 6 more seasons of suffering?  You all should be inured to it by now.  Just stock up on those paper bags to cover your faces."<br />
<br />
"Any more questions?  No?  Good. Now I need to get back to work," said the president as he left hurriedly from the room.<br /><br /><br />
