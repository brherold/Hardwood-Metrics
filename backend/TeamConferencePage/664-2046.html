Oct 07 2038:  <b>Fredonia Blue Devils Make Historic Leap to NCAA Division I</b> - <i>by CoachPaw on May 4th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
<i>Fredonia, NY</i> – For the first time in school history, the SUNY Fredonia Blue Devils men's basketball team will compete at the NCAA Division I level. This monumental achievement comes after a remarkable season under Head Coach Charley Lee, who has delivered on his promises in his third year at the helm.<br />
<br />
"This is a historic moment for Fredonia athletics," said Director of Athletics Pete Carry. "Coach Lees has built a winning culture here, and his dedication to excellence has propelled our program to this new level."<br />
<br />
The Blue Devils soared to a stellar 37-8 record last season, showcasing their dominance within the conference. They reached the conference finals for the second consecutive year, finishing with a commanding 3-1 record. Additionally, Fredonia secured their second consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament, a testament to their consistent strength.<br />
<br />
Leading the charge into Division I are a group of talented and experienced players. Senior guard Austin Tompkins, a true Fredonia legend, returns for his final season.  His electrifying play and leadership will be crucial for the Blue Devils' success.  Joining Tompkins is fellow senior forward Mario Knox, a force to be reckoned with on both ends of the court.<br />
<br />
An exciting addition to the roster is freshman power forward Mark Gold.  Gold boasts an impressive resume, starting in over 95% of his high school games and finishing his senior year with a remarkable 56% shooting percentage.  His impressive 9 player of the game honors point to a bright future with the Blue Devils.<br />
<br />
"We are incredibly excited to embark on this new journey in Division I basketball," said Coach Lee. "We have a talented group of players who are hungry for success, and we are confident that we can compete at the highest level."<br /><br /><br />

Nov 07 2037:  <b>Blue Devils Upset: DII Fredonia Shocks #25 Ranked Bentley in Wild Offensive Showcase</b> - <i>by CoachPaw on March 19th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Fredonia, NY – Buckle up, college basketball fans, because we just witnessed a night for the history books! The SUNY Fredonia Blue Devils (5-1), a force to be reckoned with in Division II, took down the nationally ranked Bentley Falcons (Division I, #1 RPI) in a barnburner of a game, 110-89. This wasn't your typical David vs. Goliath matchup; this was an offensive explosion that left fans on the edge of their seats.<br />
<br />
From the opening tip, it was clear something special was brewing. The Blue Devils, hungry and motivated, came out firing on all cylinders. Zion English, a Senior SF with an unmatched flair, established himself as the star of the show. English poured in 28 points, slashing through the Falcon defense with a scorching 9-for-12 shooting performance. He wasn't a one-man show, though. The ever-reliable Mario Knox came alive, putting on a clinic of efficiency, going a remarkable 14-for-18 from the field for a jaw-dropping 29 points.<br />
<br />
The Bentley Falcons, known for their high-octane offense, tried everything to keep pace. But the Blue Devils' relentless pressure and suffocating defense forced turnovers and contested shots. Every time the Falcons threatened to make a run, Fredonia had an answer, with clutch baskets and defensive stops that sent the crowd into a frenzy.<br />
<br />
The atmosphere at the Steele Hall Field House was electric. Every basket, every steal, every rebound was met with thunderous roars from the Fredonia faithful. This wasn't just a basketball game; it was a celebration of heart, hustle, and an underdog story coming to life.<br />
<br />
"This is what small town basketball dreams are made of" exclaimed a jubilant Fredonia coach, Charley Lee, after the game. "Our guys played their hearts out tonight. We knew Bentley was a tough opponent, but we believed in ourselves, and we went out there and proved it. I know our boys have it in them to beat any NCAA opponent."<br />
<br />
This win is a statement for the SUNY Fredonia Blue Devils. At 5-1, they've started their season strong, exceeding expectations and putting the college basketball world on notice. With a potent offense led by English and Knox, and a gritty defense that refuses to back down, this Blue Devils team is a force to be reckoned with. Remember the name, folks, because SUNY Fredonia might just have a Cinderella run in store for us this season.<br /><br /><br />

Oct 17 2037:  <b>SUNY Fredonia Blue Devils Poised for Deep Run in DII Debut After Championship Run</b> - <i>by CoachPaw on March 13th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Fredonia, N.Y. – The SUNY Fredonia Blue Devils Men's Basketball team is buzzing with anticipation as they prepare for their inaugural season in NCAA Division II. Head Coach Charley Lee, now in his second year at the helm, has instilled a winning culture in his short tenure, leading the Blue Devils to a dramatic championship game appearance last season. While they ultimately fell short of the ultimate prize, their resilience throughout the grueling postseason culminated in a 2-1 Tournament record, solidifying their position as a rising force in the region.<br />
<br />
Coach Lee is optimistic about the Blue Devils' chances in DII, citing the team's exceptional chemistry as a key advantage. With only one senior departing, the core of the championship-caliber squad remains intact. Fans can expect a high-octane offensive attack orchestrated by Junior point guard Austin Thompson. A two-time All-Conference selection, Thompson's electrifying playmaking abilities were on full display last season. Prior to his stellar sophomore campaign, Thompson garnered "Freshman of the Year" honors, showcasing his immense talent and potential.<br />
<br />
Beyond Thompson, the Blue Devils boast a talented supporting cast, including Senior Zion English, eager to prove themselves on the DII stage. The team returns a plethora of experienced upperclassmen who played pivotal roles in their recent success. This blend of seasoned veterans and hungry newcomers has fostered a competitive environment in practice, pushing each player to new heights.<br />
<br />
"The energy in the gym is electric," says Coach Lee. "These guys are hungry to compete at the next level. We learned a lot from our Tournament experience last season, and that will undoubtedly benefit us in DII. We have a solid core of returning players, and we're excited to see our young talent develop. Our goal is clear: to make a splash in DII and contend for a national championship."<br />
<br />
The Blue Devils kick off their season on October 21st against Georgia College, a matchup that promises to be a true test of their capabilities. With a passionate coaching staff, a seasoned core, and a rising star in Austin Thompson, SUNY Fredonia is poised to make a significant statement in their DII debut. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for the Blue Devils – they're a team on a mission, ready to leave their mark on the national landscape.<br /><br /><br />

Nov 15 2036:  <b>SUNY Fredonia Welcomes Charley Lee As New Head Coach</b> - <i>by CoachPaw on January 26th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
     For the past 8 years SUNY Fredonia has been working on building back their program from the ground up.<br />
A team whos best players were once all 1 star recruits, all of a sudden has been the talk of the town and has become a team worth playing for.<br />
<br />
Cliff Moretti (whos been entered into their HOF) can be credited with most the work and dedication towards bringing a basketball program back to Fredonia College. He announced his retirement last year as his final year, and Fredonia is extremely proud to announce that they have brought in Charley Lee from the Sydney Tigers as their new head coach. He brings 24 years of head coaching experience to Suny Fredonia and is ready to finally bring the school even closer to becoming a top tier school.<br />
Definitely be on the lookout for this up and coming team!<br /><br /><br />
