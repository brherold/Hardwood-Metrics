Dec 11 2031:  <b>Davis & Elkins’ Marc David and His Time Manipulation Power on Display Against Greensboro</b> - <i>by David Elkins-Davis on April 27th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
The Senators won against Greensboro. The Senators, as the home team, unsurprisingly chose to allow superpowers during the game. Although Greensboro only trailed by 6 at halftime, the Senators turned it on in the second half, outscoring their opponent 30-9. Although it turned out that Greensboro Junior Center Jeremy Harlow has the ability to turn his legs into springs, netting him 11 rebounds, the team was otherwise deplete of special powers. D&amp;E on the other hand showed a wide range of abilities, but none were on display more than Senior Marc Davis’. Davis used his Time Manipulation to put the other players into stasis for just a few seconds giving him a slight edge on his moves. Even though he seems to have a limited number of charges and only moves slightly faster than those around him, it allowed him to get 23pts, 4reb and 4ast. As the year progresses it will be exciting to see the emergence of all of the D&amp;E, and Conference VI.28, superpowers.<br /><br /><br />

Dec 06 2031:  <b>School President Praises New Rules Allowing Superpowers</b> - <i>by David Elkins-Davis on April 26th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
In a press conference following the team’s loss yesterday to Akron, Davis &amp; Elkins President Abe Froman (formerly known as David Elkins-Davis) gave a fiery speech about the recent decision surrounding the use of superpowers in college basketball. “I’ve worked tirelessly over the last 5 years, publicly and behind the scenes, to make space in the Hardwood League for ‘extra-talented individuals,’” Froman began. “Although I would have liked to see Commissioner Steve give blanket approval to the use of superpowers on the court, I appreciate that at least in Conference VI.28 we will have a hybrid season where powers will be usable in some games. Although Akron banned powers in our game today, as is the home team’s right under current rules, we will see less and less of that as other teams recruit, as D&amp;E has for years, for Gifted Youngsters.”<br /><br /><br />

Nov 27 2031:  <b>Davis & Elkins Team Photo 2032</b> - <i>by David Elkins-Davis on April 23rd, 2023</i> <br /><br />
The Senators opened their season at home with a close win over the Saint Martins Saints. Junior Bernie Davis took POTG honors for the team, which was restricted from using any super-powers during the game. President Abe Froman, the sausage magnate and pro-mutant billionaire, was in attendance, glaring down from his box. The team photo can be found below.<br />

Nov 30 2030:  <b>Davis & Elkins on a Roll</b> - <i>by David Elkins-Davis on March 1st, 2023</i> <br /><br />
In a real barnburner of a game Davis &amp; Elkins pick up their first conference win, edging Dominican Illinois 51-42. It’s not often that a team wins with just 51 points but running a 7-man rotation, D&amp;E prefer to play a slow game. It helped that Dominican Illinois were shot-handed, with two players out with food poisoning. Davis and Davis both had 13 points to lead Davis &amp; Elkins but Davis won out for POTG. <br /><br /><br />

Nov 28 2030:  <b>Davis & Elkins Tough Start to Conference Play</b> - <i>by David Elkins-Davis on February 28th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Despite nearly making the promotion to D2 last year D&amp;E have had a rough start to conference play. Todays game against Manhattanville saw a very tough close loss despite two opposing players out of commission due to food poisoning. In the end the breaks went the other way. Highlights for the team were Davis scoring 24 points and Davis getting 3 steals and a block to go with his 7 points. Up next the Senators will hit the road to play Dominican Illinois. <br /><br /><br />
