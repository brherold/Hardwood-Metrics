Jan 04 2035:  <b>marauder mayhem is on the move!</b> - <i>by baller1987 on October 20th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Well, after what proved to be some lean times during last year's campaign, the marauders appear to have found their footing again and are off to a rip roaring start, winning nine of their last ten conference games, beating their opponents soundly in both points and rebounds,  winning by an average of better than 13 points per outing and outboarding the opponent by more than five per contest.  Leading the charge for this band of point stealers is Junior college all-american Jesse George from Illinois.  George is averaging nearly 20 points while dishing out better than 4 dimes per contest.  the fact that he has two solid post players to throw too should not be lost on the critics.  Seven-one sophomore big man Darious Griffin has seemingly birst on the sceen giving the squad a real shot in the arm with his 11.2 points and nearly 1.5 block shots per game.  Gilbert Doyle and Mike Solomon have been swapping time between power forward and center as situation calls for and this has only to fule the fire power of the marauders.  While the majority of the conference is made up of admittedly less talented teams, the boys from Gilberforce are on their way to what could be a championship run and a definite spot in the divisional playoffs and perhaps even a chance at a tournament berth.  The coaching staff has also been out on the recruiting trail and it has proven successful with a solid recruiting class for next season which bodes well for some potential success in the forseeable future. <br /><br /><br />

Mar 24 2033:  <b>Marauders next season</b> - <i>by baller1987 on July 24th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Well the Central State squad in their 2nd season in division 2 found the sledding kind of a tough go, going 15-15 in conference play, dropping their last 4 contests in blowout fashion  and then being bounced out of the Division 2 playoffs in the first round. But they eaked out just enough wins to assure themselves a spot in next year's division 2 roster of teams.  the Marauders lose two of their top scorers in 6'10-1/2 Center Latrelle Lloyd and 6'9 pf Marshall Wagner who, along with Brent Corbet and Roy Morton, provided the horsepower that made this team run.  The Marauders bring in a solid recruiting class for next season, including 6'11" center Mike Solomon and 6'9" pf Gilbert Doyle.  In addition, the Marauders will be guided by Late season hire Otis Gates who took over the reigns after Hall of Fame coach Hunter Cochran suddenly and without warning resigned as head man on the bench.  It will be somewhat of a rebuilding year for the Central State squad and the development of their two young studs on the interior will go along way toward determining just how far this team can go when the upcoming conference season starts in just a few weeks.<br /><br /><br />

Feb 17 2033:  <b>7 year regime ends for Cochran</b> - <i>by baller1987 on July 13th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Coming down the home stretch of the division 2 conference race, the Marauders appear to be making a push to assure themselves a spot in the division 2 tournament.  Winners of their last two ball games, one of which was against fourth-place UC Santa Cruz, the Central State squad has been playing well recently, posting modest numbers offensively while holding the opponent in check defensively with a mixture of defensive alignments.  So it came as quite a surprise when, after posting a 2-point squeaker in their last contest, Head Coach Hunter Cochran announced his retirement from active coaching, affective immediately.  Cochran did not offer any reason for this sudden decision.  that left the Central State regime scrambling to find a replacement.  They didn't have to look far when Massachusetts native Otis Gates became available.  His impressive resume for guiding teams to success, climbing up through the division ranks made him an ideal candidate for the job as Head coach. His ability to coach offense, as well as being an excellent motivator and tactician further solidified his intrigue.  He's also a fairly good recruiter, an area  that Coach Cochran  seemingly had been slipping from in later years.  Coach Gates will attempt  to lead the squad through a tough home stretch run to position them to post season play.<br /><br /><br />

Nov 20 2032:  <b>nonconference proves more than fruitful for the marauders</b> - <i>by baller1987 on June 17th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
At the end of a 10 game nonconference schedule, the central state  squad took care of business in all but one of their nonconference games, beating their opponents, winning by an average of more than 30 points per outing and outboarding them by over 7 per contest.  Leading the charge for this band of point-stealing outlaws was 6'10 senior big man Latrell Lloyd, who boasted an 18.7 scoring average while pulling down nearly 12 rebounds in what was purely a dominating performance on the inside.  He also led the team in blocked shots, swatting away nearly 2.5 shots at the rim as easily as you might swat an annoying fly.  If Lloyd can continue his dominance in the paint in conference play, he will  surely be in the conversation for conference player of the year. Besides this beast, the marauders are also boasting stellar numbers   from sophomore forward Brett Corbet who's averaging 16.7 points per contest and fellow senior 6'9 power forward Marshall Wagner who's also putting up solid numbers inside, averaging over 17 points and 8 boards per contest.  These numbers, along with some very solid floor play of late are  indications as to why the marauders had the success they had last season when they won the division 3 conference.  Being coached by a hall of famer like Hunter Cochron should not go unnoticed either. Now they are in division 2 where the competition is sure to be much more competitive.  Stealing victories will not be nearly as easy as walking into the opponent's gym and stealing points and rebounds like they were chickens left unguarded in a henhouse. However,   the rugged play of Lloyd and Wagner on the interior along with Corbet's continued strong play on the perimeter should make for tough sledding for  their conference foes. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3347'></a>
Oct 07 2032:  <b>onward and upward</b> - <i>by baller1987 on June 5th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Having been promoted to division V.5 and returning four of its top five starters back from last year's Division 3 conference championship team, the Central State Marauders are sure to make some noise in this year's conference race.  Also, having a hall of fame coach like Hunter Cochran at the helm can't hurt either.  Leading the charge for the marauders will be senior "big man" Latrell Lloyd who boasted solid numbers from last year, averaging better than 14 points and close to 10 boards per contest.  Also returning for the squad will be pg Adrian Ogle, the team's top assist man at 7 dimes per outing.  With a veteran squad and quality players such as these, the marauders are off to what should be a successful 2033 season, even though the competition is sure to be stiffer, there's every reason for optomism for the boys from Gilberforce. <br /><br /><br />
