Dec 26 2037:  <b>Cardinals come up short at home.</b> - <i>by DunkinDribbles on April 2nd, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Loyola Maryland came out on top at Silloway today, winning a hard fought game against the Cardinals 70-62.  Loyola was led by the Greyhounds stand out point guard Solomon who poured in 34 points, shooting 4-8 from 3 and hitting 12 out of 13 free throws.  The Cardinals were playing without Randall Gibson who suffered a sprained wrist in their game against Purdue.  We asked Coach Haas how they tried to fill his shoes.<br />
<br />
"Well, we knew we had a height advantage and hoped to work the ball inside and get some easy buckets to make up some of the scoring we lost with Randall out."  The Cardinals did end up with 26 points in the paint and got some scoring from the freshman Barbour, who ended the contest with 9 points and 9 rebounds.<br />
<br />
"I think our gameplan was solid and executed it pretty well, but we did not rebound well and our ball control was attrocious.  When you add that to the 15 more points they scored at the foul line, it was more than we were able to overcome"<br />
<br />
The Cardinals ended the game with 22 turnovers five of which came in the final five minutes of the game allowing the Greyhounds to pull away and finish on top.<br />
<br />
The Cardinals big guy Grant was also injured during the game, leaving the Cardinals without two of their  best players for next weeks game against Saint Johns.  When we asked Coach Haas about this, he shook his head and said.<br />
<br />
"No comment".<br />

Dec 24 2037:  <b>Wesleyan cruises past the Boilermakers</b> - <i>by DunkinDribbles on April 1st, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Wesleyan took down the Boilermakers at Mackey today despite being tied at the half.  We asked Coach Dejonte Hass what adjustments they made at halftime that led to outscoring Purdue by 11 in the second half.  "Well, as you know we want to get out and run and put up some threes off of the break but it just wan't there in the first half and we missed quite a few.  We told the guys to slow things down just a bit and be a little more selective with their shots.  I think the change of pace and working the ball inside for closer shots helped make the difference."<br />
<br />
Purdue was led by Harmon and Bills who both achieved double double's.  Shooting Guard Randall Gibson was hurt during the game and we asked Coach Haas what the prognosis was after the game.<br />
<br />
"Randall will be back.....He has a sprained wrist, we are hearing 9 days for recovery.  So we'll lose him for three games which will hurt, that's quite a bit of scoring to replace.  But we'll address each challenge as it comes."<br />
<br />
The Cardinals take on Loyola on the 31st, a tough conference opponent with a clear chance to compete for advancement this year.<br /><br /><br />

Dec 19 2037:  <b>Dunkin addresses Cardinal Nation!</b> - <i>by DunkinDribbles on April 1st, 2024</i> <br /><br />
The New President of the Wesleyan Cardinals issued a statement this morning to the fans and players.  He expounded on the storied history of Wesleyan, looked back at the 26-4 season achieved by Coach Burris, and Coach Starkey's leadership making it to the highest conference after two back to back top three conference finishes.  He also contrasted that spark of success with the programs history of losing. "We have a program here that needs the type of TLC that only a longtime fan and alumni of Wesleyan can provide.  While we've had some successes in the past people look at Wesleyan now as a program that they always see when they look behind them.  Wesleyan can be a leader.  No more trying to catch up from the back, we want to set the pace. Cardinal Nation, our time has come.......Our time has come!!!."  While he has his critics, there's no doubt his enthusiasm has started a buzz on campus and social media.  We'll see what happens as we finish out 2038 and into the future for the Cardinals under Dunkins leadership.  <br /><br /><br />
