Mar 02 2041:  <b>Conference III.1 Chaos: The Final Day That Shook Hardwood</b> - <i>by chousley4 on October 7th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Conference III.1 2041 Season Recap:<br />
<br />
As the 2041 season in Conference III.1 came to a close, fans were treated to one of the most dramatic finales in recent memory. With promotion and relegation spots still in the balance on the final day, teams at both the top and bottom of the standings battled to secure their futures. The season was a true test of resilience, skill, and determination, with some teams rising to the challenge while others faltered when it mattered most.<br />
<br />
The Top 3: Promotion to Glory<br />
<br />
The three teams earning promotion this season—West Virginia State, Emporia State, and New Haven—all demonstrated their dominance throughout the year. West Virginia State, in particular, was a force to be reckoned with, posting a stellar 25-5 conference record and a staggering +529 point differential. Their final game, an 81-68 win over St. Peters, capped off their dominant run, securing their spot in the higher division. With a balanced offense and a defense that suffocated opponents, West Virginia proved they were the class of the conference.<br />
<br />
Emporia State followed closely behind, finishing with a 22-8 record and a +420 point differential. Their consistent performance across the season, bolstered by their ability to lock down opponents, was highlighted in their 83-55 victory over Transylvania on the final day. Emporia’s rise to promotion was well-earned, as they showed poise in critical games and handled adversity with ease.<br />
<br />
New Haven rounded out the top three with a 21-9 record and a +273 point differential. Their season was marked by an explosive offense that averaged over 86 points per game. They secured their promotion with a 92-80 victory over Redlands, demonstrating the firepower that carried them throughout the year. New Haven’s high-scoring games often kept fans on the edge of their seats, and their promotion is well-deserved.<br />
<br />
The Middle of the Pack: Staying Put<br />
<br />
While promotion was out of reach for some, a handful of teams solidified their positions in Conference III.1 for another season. Barry and Transylvania both had strong campaigns, finishing with 20-10 and 18-12 records, respectively. Barry, with an impressive +360 point differential, capped off their season with a commanding 99-43 win over East Tennessee State, ensuring their spot in the division. Transylvania, though falling to Emporia State in the final game, maintained a solid position in the standings.<br />
<br />
Howard Payne, Oral Roberts, and Morehead State also managed to stay above the relegation line with 17-13 records. Howard Payne’s final-day victory over Penn solidified their mid-table position, while Morehead State survived a tight 79-77 win over St. Marys to keep their season intact. Oral Roberts, despite a disappointing 108-89 loss to Eastern Illinois, had built enough of a cushion with a +126 point differential to avoid slipping into the danger zone.<br />
<br />
But perhaps the most nerve-wracking story came from Northwest Missouri State, who entered the final day on the brink of relegation. In need of a decisive win and some favorable results, Northwest Missouri delivered one of their best performances of the season, routing Georgia College 100-57. The victory not only boosted their record to 15-15, but their +53 point differential was enough to edge out Redlands, who finished with the same record but a slightly lower +46 differential. It was a miraculous escape for Northwest Missouri, as their season seemed headed for disaster just weeks before.<br />
<br />
Heartbreak at the Bottom: Relegation Woes<br />
<br />
For the six teams facing relegation, the final day brought a mixture of heartbreak and frustration. Redlands, despite a respectable season, found themselves demoted due to the narrowest of margins. Their loss to New Haven and Northwest Missouri’s dominant win dropped them just below the safety line.<br />
<br />
Georgia College, Eastern Illinois, St. Peters, Penn, and East Tennessee State all ended their seasons with more despair than hope. Georgia College’s blowout loss to Northwest Missouri sealed their fate, while Eastern Illinois’ win over Oral Roberts was too little, too late to save their season.<br />
<br />
At the very bottom, East Tennessee State endured a brutal campaign, finishing with a 1-29 record and a jaw-dropping -1042 point differential. Their lone win offered little consolation in what was otherwise a season to forget. Penn and St. Peters also had disastrous campaigns, with Penn finishing with a -569 point differential and just five wins.<br />
<br />
Final Day Madness: March 2nd Recap<br />
<br />
The final day of the season saw teams fighting for their lives in a series of high-stakes matchups. Northwest Missouri State delivered the performance of the day with a 100-57 demolition of Georgia College, saving their season in spectacular fashion. Meanwhile, Emporia State and West Virginia State both closed out their campaigns with dominant wins, while New Haven’s victory over Redlands secured their promotion.<br />
<br />
Other key results included Morehead State’s narrow victory over St. Marys and Eastern Illinois’ upset of Oral Roberts, a result that shook up the bottom of the standings but ultimately didn’t prevent their relegation.<br />
<br />
Looking Ahead<br />
<br />
With West Virginia State, Emporia State, and New Haven moving on to a higher division, the remaining teams in Conference III.1 will need to regroup and refocus for next season. Northwest Missouri State’s miracle escape will give them momentum heading into the offseason, while teams like Redlands and Georgia College will be left wondering what might have been. For the six teams facing relegation, the climb back to Conference III.1 will be a tough one, but their determination to return will surely fuel their efforts in the lower division.<br />
<br />
As the dust settles on the 2041 season, one thing is clear: Conference III.1 remains one of the most competitive and unpredictable leagues in the Hardwood universe, despite the wealth of talent compared to other D1 conferences. With new teams set to enter the fray and others looking to bounce back, next season promises to be just as thrilling as the one that came before it.<br /><br /><br />

Oct 07 2038:  <b>Kaczmarek Drafted by the Nuggets in Round 1!</b> - <i>by chousley4 on May 6th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
NWMO State's Star post man, Kaczmarek has been drafted 9th overall by the Denver Nuggets. There he will join last years number 1 overall pick and star center Viktor Moskvin. The Nuggets vision is for Kaczmarek and Moskvin to team up and make one of the most formidable front courts in the NBA.<br />
<br />
This is the second player from the Bearcats to be drafted in the first round. He joins fellow alum, Carlos Ornelas as being the only two players to have been drafted from the program.<br />
<br />
While the streak of first round picks may be on pause for the next few years, Coach Nielson and his staff are destined to make this campus a pipeline to the league! <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3811'></a>
Jun 30 2037:  <b>Ornelas selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1st Round! </b> - <i>by chousley4 on March 8th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Northwest Missouri State's Graduating Senior, Carolos Ornelas has been selected by Los Angeles with their first round pick of 2037 Pro Draft!<br />
<br />
This marks a significant moment in the history of the Bearcats program, as Ornelas becomes the first player to have worn the green and white to be selected in the Pro Draft.<br />
<br />
While we do not expect this to be the last pick from the program, we do want to congratulate Carlos and the entire program for this tremendous accomplishment!<br />

Apr 06 2037:  <b>The Enduring Legacy of Rahsaan &quot;Rafiki&quot; McCartney: A Tribute to a Basketball Coaching Icon</b> - <i>by chousley4 on March 7th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Rahsaan "Rafiki" McCartney's career in college basketball coaching has been nothing short of remarkable, marked by consistent success and a profound impact on the programs he led. Beginning his coaching journey at Dominican University of California (DUCA) and culminating in his tenure at Northwest Missouri State University (NWMO), McCartney's legacy is etched in the annals of collegiate basketball history.<br />
<br />
During his time at DUCA, McCartney demonstrated his ability to elevate teams to new heights. Despite starting at a modest level, he quickly made his mark, leading DUCA to multiple conference tournament titles and earning recognition for his coaching prowess. His teams consistently performed well in conference play, laying the foundation for the success that would follow.<br />
<br />
However, it was McCartney's tenure at NWMO that truly solidified his status as one of the great program builders in college basketball. Taking the helm of the historically bad program in 2029, he faced the challenge of maintaining the high standards set by his predecessors while leaving his own indelible mark. True to form, McCartney rose to the occasion, guiding NWMO to numerous conference titles, deep runs in national tournaments, and leading the program from one of the worst programs in the country to League Level 2 program and all the way to #62 rated program in the country.<br />
<br />
Notably, McCartney's impact extended beyond the basketball court. His leadership and mentorship shaped the lives of countless student-athletes, instilling in them values of discipline, resilience, and teamwork. Under his guidance, players not only excelled on the court but also grew as individuals, preparing them for success beyond their collegiate careers.<br />
<br />
McCartney's historic career is a testament to his dedication, expertise, and unwavering commitment to excellence. As he bids farewell to NWMSU, his legacy will endure, serving as inspiration for future generations of basketball players and coaches alike.<br />

Dec 21 2034:  <b>NW Missouri Faceplants Versus OK. State</b> - <i>by chousley4 on October 17th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
After some time away, the team president completely faceplants his game prep against a strong Oklahoma State team. Oklahoma State has one of the best backcourts in the conference, and for some reason NWMO decided to test that backcourt with a heavy zone. Kudos to Oklahoma State for taking advantage and handing the Bearcats their first loss of the season. Onto the next! <br /><br /><br />
