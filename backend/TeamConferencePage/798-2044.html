Mar 26 2039:  <b>Coach Warner seeks to cap off a &quot;Year of Firsts&quot; for Centre College</b> - <i>by indycolt22 on June 25th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
After narrowly missing the tournament last season, Coach Warner and the Colonels put in a relentless effort in the offseason - seeking the ever elusive NCAA D3 Tournament. The hard work, long days and seemingly endless grind appears to have paid off.<br />
<br />
The Colonels dominated their schedule and have now reached the coveted Final Four. It is the first Final Four in program history, it is Coach Warner's first NCAA Tournament (in which he now has a 4-0 record in), it is the program's first appearance in over a decade and the first in the indycolt22 and Warner era.<br />
<br />
The Colonels won their conference for the first time in 10 years as well, but couldn't cap it off with a conference tournament championship.<br />
<br />
If the success continues, Coach Warner is set to be the longest tenured coach at Centre College in a few short seasons. Danville, KY is throwing quite the party.<br />
<br />
The Colonels will play a dangerous Providence team next with an opportunity to advance to the D3 National Championship: an opportunity of a lifetime. Even if it ends here, what a wild ride it's been.<br /><br /><br />

Apr 02 2035:  <b>4 Star Center Jared Gooden Tops Historic Class for Centre</b> - <i>by indycolt22 on November 16th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
It didn’t take long for Coach Warner to work his recruiting magic for Centre College, signing 4 prospects including 4 Star Center Jared Gooden who ranks 33rd Nationally and 3rd in the state of Kentucky. Joining Gooden are 3 more home-grown prospects - 3 Star SF Reggie Russell, 2 Star PG Kevin Dennis and 2 Star Danny Vaught.<br />
<br />
The Colonels have lacked in quality scholarship players in past seasons, so signing a rather large class including one of the best players in the state is a major win for Coach Warner. We weren’t able to catch up with Warner before his annual post-season vacation, but he was able to send us a message expressing that he was “excited” to get started next season.<br /><br /><br />

Feb 14 2032:  <b>Cory Warner Wins First Game as New Head Coach</b> - <i>by indycolt22 on May 16th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
In the midst of a rocky season, the Centre College Colonels decided to part ways with former coach Kirk Ward. Initially, talks between the Colonels and Coach Ward indicated that he would remain the coach for the remainder of the season and be evaluated during the offseason, but President Indycolt22 decided to begin the transition process now.<br />
<br />
"We appreciate all that Coach Ward has done and given to this program. We wish him the best and will support him as he searches for his next coaching gig." - Indycolt22<br />
<br />
Shortly after this announcement, it was announced that Centre College would be hiring first time head coach Cory Warner. Coach Warner was previously an assistant with the Santa Clara Broncos and is from Georgia.<br />
<br />
"We are extremely excited to announce Cory Warner as our new head coach. We had to go through this process quickly because we are still in the middle of the season, but Cory was extremely excited for the opportunity and was ready to work right away. We think he will bring a recruiting and player development edge that previously we have not had at Centre. He has our full support." - indycolt22<br />
<br />
Shortly after being hired, Coach Warner led the Colonels to a win (his first career win as a head coach), against Erskine, who is now 14-10 on the season. There was plenty of late game drama and it seems Coach Warner had great strategy in an important late game scenario.<br /><br /><br />

Feb 07 2032:  <b>Centre College Colonels Announce New President of Basketball Operations</b> - <i>by indycolt22 on May 14th, 2023</i> <br /><br />
The Centre College Colonels announce indycolt22 as the new President of Basketball Operations. In an interview after joining the program, he said, "As I return to this sport and profession, I hope to take Centre College to the next level. I'm excited to join this program and cannot wait to see what we can build together."<br />
<br />
Indycolt22 was previously President of the Kentucky State Thoroughbreds in Frankfort, KY, where the team had an incredible turnaround to one of their best seasons in school history in just his third year as President. In his fourth year, he took a leave of absence and the team faltered. He resigned shortly after that due to a personal matter.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, he is excited to return to the Bluegrass State and participate in the sport he loves so dearly.<br /><br /><br />
