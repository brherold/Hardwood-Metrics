Dec 19 2043:  <b>we will we will rock you</b> - <i>by sparky on March 2nd, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Three of Hardwoods most well known presidents made the long and treacherous trip to North Adams, bringing with them gifts of gold, frankincense, and recruiting contacts for the new savior of MCLA basketball, Jermaine "The Pain" McLean. The prospect, who came forth from the womb of world renown gymnosophist Olga Chevinova, and in miraculous turn of events not only grew to 6'8" before even getting out of the nursery, but also somehow qualified academically, is the biggest get in MCLA history, way bigger than current so called stars Cocoon Boy Moran and little Torey Lewis. Are you kidding me, this guy is the real deal! As soon as he finished delivering this baby, Head Coach Clint Cherry threw open the delivery room window and screamed into the night "MCLA IS NOW UNSTOPPABLE!!! HAHAHAHAHAH THERE IS A NEW TOTAL DOMINATING FRANCHISE SLASH PROGRAM TYPE THING COMING DOWN THE PIKE!!!! <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4189'></a>
Oct 21 2043:  <b>omg</b> - <i>by sparky on February 14th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Tragedy nearly struck the MCLA basketball team today as their flight to Walla Walla came THIS close to crashing. As the chartered 737 Lockheed 5Xa twin powered combustion prop plane approached Walla Walla, the town's thick and unrelenting smog of filth and airborne slime began to pose a serious threat to all on board. The plane began to go this way and that way, and then up and down, and everybody started freaking out. Even to the aircraft's seasoned pilot, Captain Ryland Gooddorf, owner of bronze and silver stars from 16 different wars, the odds of catastrophe were too great, and he began crying like a mid-sized infant pulled from his mother's bosom.  The plane was pitched downward, racing directly to its doom, when backup PF Eric Vogel, who later revealed he used to "be really into playing FlightSimulator," raced to the cockpit and steadied the bird, before gently crashlanding it in nearby Pasco. <br /><br /><br />

Dec 04 2042:  <b>December 5th, 2042, Manhattan</b> - <i>by sparky on January 1st, 2025</i> <br /><br />
<i>Dearest MeeMaw,<br />
Yesterday was a most trying day for your dear grandson. The team, in an evocation of the most extreme listlessness, managed to lose to Pace by an unconscionable 58 points. Thereafter, in the locker room, my duty was to deliver a fiery excoriation so extreme in pitch, that I incurred a bloody nose! You would think such a display would galvanize the lads (aside from Cockrell, naturally), and it did, albeit it only temporarily. For one of the new recruits has brought along with him a woman of the gymnosophist variety, and she brings with her a capacity to meddle. Instead of rebuking the players for such a degrading humiliation, she has praised them for enduring it, claiming the ordeal was "a pious cleansing of the ego." Sadly, she is of such a feminine bearing that her words have great sway over them, and I worry that this will have a terrible affect on them moving forward.<br />
Lovingly,<br />
D'Angelo</i><br /><br /><br />

Nov 22 2042:  <b>MCLA NIL Deal the 1st in Hardwood History to Top $1 billion</b> - <i>by sparky on December 29th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
MCLA's blockbuster deal with the insanely handsome Canadian phenom Seth Johns sent shockwaves through Hardwood this morning. Johns, known also for his highly publicized relationship with social media sensation and champion <i>Belarusian</i> gymnosophist Olga Chevinova, will be donning the blue and yellow for a record breaking $1.1billion. Some MCLA insiders worry that the team's finances are already strained due to the spiraling costs of Rich Cockrell's health care. After Cockrell was run over by three steam rollers during a South Boston St. Patrick's Day parade as an infant, doctor's thought he had a less than .4% chance to live, but his unwavering determination defied all odds and eventually landed him a spot on the MCLA squad. The North Adams community has rallied behind the inspirational Cockrell, despite crude jokes made at his expense by you know who. <br /><br /><br />

Oct 22 2042:  <b>Whitman @ MCLA -4.5</b> - <i>by sparky on December 19th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Although there have been over a million games played in the Hardwood Universe, none will compare to tomorrow's matchup of Whitman v. MCLA in terms of acrimony. In fact, <i>Acrimony Magazine</i> ranked the build up to tomorrow's game as the 3rd most acrimonious phenomenon of all time. Curious onlookers, some of them not even basketball fans, have been gathering at the North Adams' Municipal Air Field to see it all begin, eagerly waiting for Whitman's plane to land. They just want to see the players emerge from its doors, and watch as the MCLA faithful raise their fists towards them, and shout all manner of phrases too unsavory for us to even think about, let alone print here in a family friendly press release. Among the crowd was Olga Chevinova, who traveled all the way from Minsk to witness what she breathlessly described as "the unfurling of hatred so pure and raw that it seems almost to be from another dimension."<br /><br /><br />
