Feb 19 2043:  <b>Rangers overhaul staff amid skid of losing seasons, hire tourney winning head coach.</b> - <i>by RowdyRanger on January 22nd, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Northwestern News 2/19/43<br />
<br />
Amid a stretch of 22 seasons without a tournament berth, the NWOSU brass has deemed it time to make sweeping changes to not only the basketball program, but the athletics department as a whole. The board of trustees has hired RowdyRanger as the new Athletic Director after removing Coach Gray months prior. The search for a new AD was "long, grueling, and about as enjoyable as kissing your sister" according to one board member.<br />
<br />
RowdyRanger gave a speech in Percefull FIeldhouse to a group of roughly 400 students, faculty, and press this morning, announcing his plans for the school's athletics moving forward. Attendees were struck by his honesty on the history of Ranger athletics; many a pearl was clutched when the fact that the school has only a single national championship across all 16 varsity programs at NWOSU, but the overwhelming feeling after the speech was one of hope and faith in Ranger athletics moving forward.<br />
<br />
Following a 58-52 dogfight with a plummeting Florida Gulf Coast team, coach Scottie Dowling was given the boot. His ~3 year tenure as coach at NWOSU ends with a record of 23-94, good for a .197 winning percentage. AD RowdyRanger gave the following statement following the release of the firing news:<br />
<br />
"Coach Dowling has given quite a bit of time and effort to this program, done a great job developing talent and bringing in great players. Unfortunately the results have not been there, and the athletics department felt it was time to move on. We wish Scottie all the best in his future endeavors, and believe he can get back to his winning ways."<br />
<br />
Replacing Coach Dowling is Hank Fields, former assistant coach at Air Force, Cal-Berkeley, and most notably Georgetown, where he helped the Hoyas go a combined 91-8 across his last two seasons there, winning a D3 national championship in 2039, making a D2 Final Four, and ultimately getting the Hoyas back to D1 after a 3 year stretch out of the top division of the NCAA.<br />
<br />
When asked about his coaching philosophy, Coach Fields said he'll be focusing on "getting talent to Alva, getting the best out of the guys we've got, and playing hard as nails." Fields was greeted by team captain, Dick Green, this afternoon. Green was overheard saying he was excited to work with a "real winner" like Fields.<br /><br /><br />
