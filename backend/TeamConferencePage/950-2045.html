<h3>Press Releases:</h3>
<a id='releases_2081'></a>
Mar 13 2022:  <b>Back to Back Champs</b> - <i>by weaponx84 on November 12th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
For the second year in a row the Chargers have won the conference playoff. Fred Pollock was the playoff MVP for the chargers scoring 21.8 ppg on 74.5% shooting and adding 5 boards 2.8 steals and 2 blocks winning 3 of the 4 players of the game. Lane Schultz and Curt McCarty also contributed heavily in each game. Coach Hairston praised the whole team and pointed out that the bench played a great roll especially on defense.<br />
<br />
We look forward to another run in the tournament and facing off against another V.15 conference team the Nevada Wolfpack.  <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1992'></a>
Mar 14 2021:  <b>Chargers win the Conference Playoffs</b> - <i>by weaponx84 on September 17th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The Chargers are winners of the 2021 conference playoffs. Lane Schultz was the team MVP scoring 20 ppg, over 12 RPG and 2 blocks. He was also great from three shooting over 50%. Fredrick Robinson and Gregg Dunlap were also great contributors and were shut down defenders. Looking forward to competing in the tournament and seeing how far this team can go. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1733'></a>
Jan 24 2019:  <b>Recruitment News</b> - <i>by weaponx84 on May 14th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
The Chargers are excited about their two new recruits signed. Coach Humphreys said "Diogo Varejao may be redshirted next year is a raw talent but at 7 feet tall and the ability to stretch the floor he has a ton of promise. Lane Schultz is a player we have looked at for three years and are thrilled to have him as well. He more than likely will play as a true freshman and will compete with Redshirt freshman Fred Pollack for the starting job next year. We have two guys graduating this year and needed depth in our front court so we are very happy to get help at the Center and Power Forward positions."<br />
<br />
The Chargers still have 3 scholarships remaining for the upcoming year and are not done yet. The recruitment team is working hard to keep this team competitive for years to come. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1614'></a>
Mar 17 2018:  <b>Thanking Anderson Buffington</b> - <i>by weaponx84 on April 5th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
With the Chargers losing in the second round of the tournament, we would like to thank Anderson Buffington for his work in turning around the program over the past 4 years.<br />
<br />
He ends his career as a 3 year starter and has the 4th most points, 6th in total assists and 2nd in total 3 pointers made. He persevered over his first two seasons with two losing seasons but kept improving and making his teammates better as well and being the leader over the past two seasons.<br />
<br />
In his only 2 appearance in the tournament this year he averaged 17 points and 3 assists while shooting 50% from the field and from three and having a perfect percentage at the free throw line.<br />
<br />
Hugh Humphreys said Anderson would be missed and has left some pretty big shoes to fill but also said he is excited about having 5 returning seniors and thinks that will help the program continue to succeed. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_1387'></a>
Mar 11 2017:  <b>Complete turn around</b> - <i>by weaponx84 on February 5th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
With the Chargers now in the conference championship it is time to reflect. This team was on a four year decline with not even being close to a winning season. Now after a few years focused on recruiting, a change in coaching and a couple rough years we are now back in the championship game and look forward to the future in building a strong program. <br /><br /><br />
