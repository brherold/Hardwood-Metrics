Feb 20 2044:  <b>Mission Accomplished, But We‚Äôre Not Done Yet!</b> - <i>by mason on March 21st, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Tiger Nation, stand up! We did it! With three games still left in the season, Grambling State has officially clinched promotion to Division II‚Äîa goal we set from day one. But if you think we‚Äôre coasting now, think again. The squad has its sights set on the Division III Tournament, and right now, we‚Äôre right on track to make it.<br />
<br />
Nobody embodies this team‚Äôs heart and hustle more than our senior point guard, Dennis Spears, who‚Äôs been running the show all season. After locking in our promotion, Spears couldn‚Äôt help but reflect on how far this team has come.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúWhen I got here, Coach told me, ‚ÄòDennis, you‚Äôre gonna lead this team to history.‚Äô I thought he meant, like, a cool record or something. But D-II? The tournament?! Somebody better build me a statue!‚Äù Spears joked after our latest win.<br />
<br />
Coach and the staff couldn‚Äôt be prouder of this group of guys. They fought for everything, played with grit, and earned their spot. But we‚Äôre not hanging the sneakers up yet‚Äîwe‚Äôve got a tournament to make, and once we‚Äôre there, anything can happen.<br />
<br />
Let‚Äôs finish strong. Let‚Äôs make history. Go Tigers! üèÄüí™<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4195'></a>
Nov 28 2043:  <b>Grambling State Hoops: Chasing Greatness, One Win at a Time</b> - <i>by mason on February 24th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
The Tigers are on a mission this season, and we‚Äôre not just talking about stacking up W‚Äôs‚Äîwe‚Äôre aiming for a top-three finish in conference play and punching our ticket to Division II.<br />
<br />
Leading the charge? None other than All-Conference shooting guard, Herman Parrott. If you haven‚Äôt been watching, you‚Äôre missing out. The man is playing like he‚Äôs got a turbo button. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the extra reps or my grandma‚Äôs gumbo, but I feel unstoppable,‚Äù Parrott said after dropping 23 points, 7 assists, and 6 steals last game. Whatever it is, we‚Äôre here for it.<br />
<br />
The team is locked in, the fans are bringing the energy, and the goal is clear. We‚Äôre coming for that top-three finish, and nothing less. Stay tuned, Tiger Nation‚Äîthis is gonna be a season to remember!<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_715'></a>
Oct 04 2012:  <b>2012 Awards</b> - <i>by mason on May 11th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
Grambling State's most improved player is Roland Trent. The coach has saw him put in a ton of work in 2012, earning all-conference honors. We hope he will be up for the challenge of learning the point guard position in his senior season.<br />
<br />
Emmanuel Hardy is our 2012 Most Valuable Player. He also was able to grab an all-conference slot and we are all extremely excited to see what he can do in his last year here in Grambling.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_689'></a>
Mar 03 2012:  <b>End of 2012 season wrap</b> - <i>by mason on April 27th, 2020</i> <br /><br />
We expected this to be a tough season so we exceeded our expectations by finishing conference play with the same 18-12 record we had last season. We did it with the 2nd ranked offense in our conference led by the most accurate 3 point shooting. We only have one player graduating, so our goal for next season is to promote.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_547'></a>
Mar 10 2011:  <b>End of Season Wrap</b> - <i>by mason on March 3rd, 2020</i> <br /><br />
We had some great moments this season so I know everybody is disappointed to see our run end so early. We finished conference play 18-12 which only earned us 8th in the only conference in Hardwood with no 11-16 win teams this season. We finished with the 4th ranked defense and the 8th ranked offense. Now some awards:<br />
<br />
<i>Grambling Playoff MVP:</i> Dale Norris<br />
It sucks to have to base this award on just one game for the second consecutive season. Foul trouble gave this amazing walk on an increased role in the last game of his career and he capitalized. His shot was on point today and he was our top scorer. He will be missed.<br />
<br />
<i>Grambling State Most Improved:</i> Roland Trent and Emmanuel Hardy<br />
Both these sophomores deserve a mention here for finishing this season as far better players than they were at the start of it.<br />
<br />
Finally, <i>Grambling Conference-Play MVP:</i> Charles Tuttle<br />
For the second straight year it is clear that Tuttle has been the most impactful player on the court. Averaging a double-double, he was tied for 2nd most POTG honors in the conference with 12. Maybe I'm counting my chickens before they hatch, but I expect to see him on the all-conference team. He will be missed.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm excited to announce we've scheduled 4 very challenging rivalries against Vanderbilt, St. Thomas, Tulane, and Mississippi St.<br /><br /><br />
