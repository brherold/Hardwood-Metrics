Feb 23 2045:  <b>UNE Clinches Division Title with Two Games to Spare</b> - <i>by rlawrence on May 17th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Biddeford, ME — The University of New England Nor’easters are officially Conference IV.3 regular season champions. With two games still left on the calendar, UNE’s 26th win of the year sealed the division title, capping off a dominant campaign defined by stifling defense, efficient offense, and the relentless production of their veteran core.<br />
<br />
Leading the charge has been senior PG J. Webb, the team’s floor-general and emotional heartbeat. Averaging 16.5 points on a blistering 59.4% shooting, Webb has powered the Nor’easters' offense with a consistent blend of driving and distributing. He’s not just a finisher — he’s a tone-setter, drawing fouls, fighting through contact, and racking up a team-high 7 Player of the Game honors.<br />
<br />
Beside him, Kent Zimmerman has been the Nor’easters’ two-way workhorse. The senior big man is averaging a double-double with 16.0 points and 10.5 rebounds, showcasing relentless effort on the glass and silky touch around the rim. Zimmerman leads the team in plus-minus at +15.5, a testament to how often UNE controls the game with him on the floor.<br />
<br />
But no player has elevated their game more in big moments than Kent Reedy. The dominant PF has become UNE’s quiet assassin — averaging 14.3 points on 61.5% shooting, often getting to his spots without forcing the issue. Reedy’s size, footwork, and poise have made him a matchup nightmare.<br />
<br />
The team’s blueprint has remained steady: defense-first identity, leading the league in forced turnovers, and an offense built on smart decisions and high-percentage looks.<br />
<br />
With the division title in hand and eyes now set on postseason success, the Nor’easters have made one thing clear: this season runs through Biddeford.<br /><br /><br />

Jan 05 2045:  <b>Zimmerman Dominates as Nor’easters Blitz UC Irvine Early, Win 87–71</b> - <i>by rlawrence on May 2nd, 2025</i> <br /><br />
January 5, 2045 | Irvine, CA – Bren Events Center | Attendance: 7,500<br />
<br />
The University of New England Nor’easters stormed to an early lead and never looked back, defeating UC Irvine 87–71 behind a dominant performance from center Kent Zimmerman, who posted 33 points and 13 rebounds.<br />
<br />
UNE blitzed the Anteaters with a 56–26 first-half explosion, using an aggressive pace and high-pressure defense to force 13 turnovers before the break. Zimmerman set the tone, shooting 11-of-21 from the field—including 3-of-3 from deep—and 8-of-11 from the line.<br />
<br />
“Our first-half energy was off the charts,” said head coach Tommy Vinson. “Zimmerman set the tone, and everyone followed.”<br />
<br />
Guards J. Webb and P. Radović combined for 25 points and 9 assists, while forward Kent Reedy added 11 points, 6 boards, and key defensive plays.<br />
<br />
UC Irvine appeared to get the better of UNE in the second half, but this was clearly a result of the Nor'easters effort to preserve the win,  shifting  to a slower tempo and zone containment.<br />
<br />
“Big road win,” Zimmerman said. “But we’re chasing something bigger this season.”<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4156'></a>
Mar 05 2043:  <b>Nor&#39;Easters Hit Twenty Year Low, Coach Beard Let Go</b> - <i>by rlawrence on January 27th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
In a close relegation battle, UNE was just points shy of winning the tie-breaker and staying up. Instead, and for the first time in 20 seasons, they drop down to LL4.<br />
<br />
Twenty-year Coach Stan Beard was immediately let go.<br />
<br />
"Listen, Stan is one of the reasons we were able to climb all the way to Legends and make it to a Tournament Final," said President Lawrence, "We appreciate everything he's done for us, but everyone know's we've been declining for sometime. It's just time for new blood."<br />
<br />
And new blood it is! Coach Tommy Vinson is a local hero from New England just getting started as the Lead man.  Known for his cutting edge systems on offense and defense, He's sure to bring something new to the club.<br />
<br />
<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3978'></a>
Apr 04 2039:  <b>UNE Finishes Third Straight Winning Season in II.1</b> - <i>by rlawrence on June 27th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
The Nor'Easters have posted another winning season in II.1, bringing their Conference record to 51-39 over the last three seasons.<br />
<br />
"We've tried to stay in 'the hunt' every year, you never know when you can just make that push", rlawrence stated.  "We even got a win over Tournament Champions STA this year.  Sadly, we're losing three great players to graduation, but that's the way the business works"<br />
<br />
Fans are a bit less optimistic as they look at the underclassmen, wondering if there will be enough depth and talent to avoid relegation next year, much less make a run.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_3914'></a>
Sep 02 2038:  <b>Injury Plagued Season Limits UNE to Mediocrity</b> - <i>by rlawrence on May 3rd, 2024</i> <br /><br />
As the sun set on season 2038, UNE nearly topped the II.1 leader-board with a very important statistic ... injuries. Most notable being their prolific, 6'9" senior PG, Patrick Prince.<br />
<br />
The hopes for Prince were very high at the beginning of the season, some projecting him to be the All-League PG, or perhaps even challenge for the highest scorer in the league.  But down the stretch he just couldn't stay healthy, suffering a trifecta of injuries that put him on the bench for 8 conference games.<br />
<br />
Rookie PG Holder was called on to do much more than he could handle and by the time Prince was healthy again, with only 3 games left, the Nor'Easters were out of contention for promotion.<br />
<br />
Fans got a healthy preview of the upcoming young talent to finish off the season. With Prince gone, and Fair being drafted into the NBA with the #17 pick, it's likely the Nor'easters will have another mid-table winning season next year.<br />
<br />
Senior SG Pat Rogers hopes to have something to say about that. In the void left with the injured Prince he stepped up to the plate in a big way, becoming the engine for the offense and securing the All-Conference SG award. He has another full season ahead of him and hopes to make an even bigger impact.<br />
