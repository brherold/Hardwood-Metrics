<h3>Press Releases:</h3>
<a id='releases_4288'></a>
Dec 08 2044:  <b>A Sheep in Wolf&#39;s Clothing</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on April 25th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Before practice today, Coach Ferguson was asked if he had any comments or thoughts on the "Press Release War" between Elmhurst and NC State, here is his response:<br />
"Robert A. Faganel donated more money to this wonderful university than Mr. Mortal will ever sniff. So, no, I don't see why I should be concerned with what they have to say. It's beneath us."<br />
<br />
Redshirt Sophomore Point Guard, Daniel Rodriguez or "D-Rod," tweeted on his X account earlier this morning saying: "Being tall doesn't make you good lol" with a skull emoji to boot.<br />
Star Big, Callum Gibbs, who missed the game with back issues later quoted his teammates Tweet saying: "Lowkey, roll Bluejays." Both of these posts got plenty of love from their teammates and Bluejays Faithful.<br />
<br />
The Boys in Blue will continue this newly formed, heated rivalry with NC State on January 28th when they travel to Raleigh. Coach Ferg stated that he is planning on taking the team to the Bentonville Battlefield so that they could "learn some proper history" while in the state.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4285'></a>
Dec 08 2044:  <b>Bluejays Down the Wolfpack, Lost Causer Owner</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on April 24th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
This is my shot across the bow to that secessionist chump at NC State. You're not that guy pal, trust me. <br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4262'></a>
Oct 15 2044:  <b>Coach JB OUT, Coach Honcho IN</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on April 9th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Following the final pre-season scrimmage for the Bluejays, Coach Jon Bowen "JB" was informed by senior administrators at Elmhurst that he would not be leading the Bluejays in the upcoming season. This decision was made in light of the recent revelations that Elmhurst's Compliance Office has found in their investigation into the scuffle between Coach JB and Coach Reek, who was already terminated by the university. Coach Bowen was found to be perpetrating a hostile and toxic culture and had manipulated access to the gym's water heaters, refusing to provide hot water to players unless he deemed their effort levels to be sufficient.<br />
Coach Rafael "Honcho" Ferguson will be getting his first shot at leading a team. The Bluejays' program hopes to strengthen their recruiting efforts and contacts with Coach Ferguson. Honcho Ferguson is arriving at Elmhurst as a highly regarded leader of men, an excellent teacher of the game, and has earned a wealth of experience with a winning program during his tenure at Dominican University of California.<br /><br /><br />
<a id='releases_4249'></a>
Sep 01 2044:  <b>Long Time Assistant Coach SACKED</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on April 4th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
Fan favorite and long time Assistant <i>to</i> the Head Coach Enrique "Reek" Covarrubias was shown the exit on the morning of April 4th. A pillar of the program's construction, Covarrubias was considered for the gig of bench boss every time there was a vacancy in R.A. *** Hall. Unfortunately, the overachieving, long time Assistant <i>to</i> the Head Coach, was overlooked every opportunity that a promotion was available. Coach "Reek" was beloved by the players he coached and mentored during his tenure with Elmhurst, Coach Reek was given the privilege to mentor Elmhurst legends such as "Money" Moses, Eli Burnett, and Ron Howell.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Coach Reek was never given the opportunity due to his perceived lack of motivational skills, laissez faire approach to player development, and rough around the edges approach to recruiting prospects. Being one of President Hardin's first hires, Covarrubias's exit is tough for everyone in Elmhurst.<br />
<br />
Tensions came to a head during an end of season Coaches meeting when Coach Reek exclaimed that had the Boys in Blue used his scouting reports more often then maybe Coach Bowen's win percentage would be higher, and as a matter of fact, the Bluejays would have beaten Connecticut College in the Conference Semifinals had they switched McCune off of Barbour in an attempt to prevent the power forward from having a career day. A scuffle ensued between Coach Jon Bowen and his Assistant <i>to</i> the Head Coach began shoving and exchanging blows with each other while the other coaches and support staff attempted to break up the fight. Coach Reek walked out of the building under his own will, happy to finally get a fair shot at a head coaching gig.<br />
<br />
Coach Reek Covarrubias finished his time at Elmhurst helping the Bluejays to a 193-141 and a Conference Tournament Championship in 2043.<br /><br /><br />

Mar 05 2044:  <b>Big Recruiting Class Finalized</b> - <i>by bhardin22 on March 24th, 2025</i> <br /><br />
In a season of new milestones for Elmhurst, perhaps the most impressive feat has been the Class of 2044 recruiting class.<br />
Including the first 4 star recruit under President Hardin (Melvin Carlson), the '44 recruiting class boasts 2 other 3 star recruits hailing from Chicago.<br />
<br />
4 Star big Melvin Carlson gives Bluejays faithful something to look forward to for the next 5 years. The 51st ranked player in the nation and the number 1 recruit out of Arkansas, Melvin will bring his 3 level scoring abilities up north to Chicago. While he may be done growing, Coach Bowen is planning to get Mr. Carlson all of his minutes at the 4.<br />
<br />
3 Star PG "Blue" Lou Bell looks to fill the shoes of Clay Alexander as the primary ballhandler and orchestrator of the Bluejays offense. Blue Lou's incredible wingspan will help him spearhead the defensive attack for Coach Bowen. A 4.0 student and IHSA state finalist in the 100 and 200 meter dashes, Bell will be bringing loads of intelligence and speed to the bluejays back court.<br />
<br />
3 Star Combo Guard Les Worley will be arriving at Elmhurst as the 17th ranked player in the state of Illinois. While he is not projected to grow as tall as Blue Lou or be as quick, Les's lockdown defense and 3 level scoring ability with elite shooting from downtown will complement nicely with his future classmates offensive abilities.<br /><br /><br />
