Mar 30 2024:  <b>You Can&#39;t Win &#39;em All</b> - <i>by thpoole on March 9th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
After accruing 112 wins over the previous two seasons, many fans assumed that Sal Schrock had yet another card up his sleeve, that the Eagle's winning ways would continue. However, the 2023-2024 season proved to be a disappointing one in Durham. A late-season skid that saw Central go 1-11 over a twelve-game stretch sunk the Eagles into the relegation zone, and that proved to be the death blow for their season. The Eagles suffered their first demotion under head coach Sal Schrock, but fans can take solace in knowing that Central will still be competing in Division 1 next season.<br />
<br />
There are reasons for both optimism and pessimism headed into the next season. This year's team was powered by the frontcourt duo of Herman Edwards and Ramon Valdes, both of whom will be graduating. The pair combined for over 45% of the Eagles scoring last season, which will be tough to replace. The defensive-minded small forward Bernardo Murillo is also departing.<br />
<br />
Despite this, there are new faces who are sure to excite Eagles fans for the next 4 years. NCC pulled in the 19th ranked recruiting class this season, headlined by Kahil Fox, the #10 rated player in his class. Joining him are a pair of 3-stars in Bob Ryan and Mason Daniels. There are also 3 red-shirt freshmen who will be joining the team next season. SF Brian Banks was the crown-jewel of Schrock's last recruiting class, and while Fox will get a lot of the media buzz, Eagle's fans should be looking forward to Bank's debut as well. Joining Banks are big-men Ed Fraley and Josh Wilkinson. Both have monster builds, with impressive height, length, and verticality. Both are also fast for their size and possess the ability to stretch the floor. If these two can develop together as a frontcourt, the departure of Edwards and Valdes might be nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
Another name to remember going into next season is Gerald Dow. Last year, I commented that Herman Edwards was primed for a breakout year. This time, I believe that man is Dow. The RS Jr has shown excellent growth during his time in Durham, and his efficient scoring and impressive defense will finally get a chance to shine in the starting lineup next season.<br />

Apr 01 2023:  <b>Rising to the Occasion</b> - <i>by thpoole on January 12th, 2022</i> <br /><br />
What a year it has been for the Eagles. In last years' end-of-season write-up, I wrote that "promotion likely isn't in the cards next season". 35 wins and 12 months later, North Carolina Central are regular-season conference champions for the second consecutive year and are promoting for the third straight year. For the program's first-ever season competing in Division 1, it was a resounding success.<br />
<br />
As for next year, we may have finally reached the point where the Eagles have run out of steam. 3 out of 5 starters are departing, and it seems likely that Central will employ two underclassmen in the backcourt next year. Their lack of experience may put a cap on what this team can achieve in III.2, but the talent is there to potentially avoid relegation. All eyes will be on Senior PF Herman Edwards, who has big expectations on his shoulders heading into next season.<br />
<br />
With our loss in the first round of the tourney, the careers of two Eagles legends come to an end. Erick McCune and Tracy Stowe have presided over the most successful period in school history. Together they hold multiple school records and contributed to 131 wins, 2 conference regular-season titles, 1 conference tournament title, and 3 national tournament appearances. They leave as respectively the greatest point guard and the greatest center in school history, and both will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.<br />

Apr 04 2022:  <b>A Year to Remember</b> - <i>by thpoole on November 18th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
At last year's end-of-season press conference NC Central athletic director Thomas Poole made a bold prediction, that the Eagles would secure promotion to Division 1 for the first time in school history. Few thought that would come to pass, but as it turns out Poole may have been <i>underselling</i> the potential of the 2022 Eagles. Led by 4th-year head coach Sal Schrock, NC Central secured a school-record 41 wins to go along with a conference regular-season title, a conference tournament title, and a sweet-sixteen appearance in the Division 2 tournament. By all accounts, it was the best season the Eagles have enjoyed in their program's history.<br />
<br />
The best part is, this isn't even the end for Durham's golden generation. Schrock returns 3/5 starters, including leading scorer Tracy Stowe and star point guard Erik McCune. The Eagles will be expecting big things from the junior trio of Bernardo Murillo, Herman Edwards, and Ramon Valdes, who all project to have bigger roles next season. While promotion likely isn't in the cards next season, Central fans have every reason to believe that they can avoid relegation next season.<br />
<br />
For many fans, it will doubtlessly be tough to see two players who were instrumental in getting NC Central to Division 1 sitting in the stands next season. Walt Baker will be joining the staff as a graduate assistant, while Bart McKee will be taking his talents overseas to pursue a professional career. Both will be sorely missed on the court, and their contributions to this program will never be forgotten.<br />

Sep 02 2021:  <b>Great Expectations</b> - <i>by thpoole on September 24th, 2021</i> <br /><br />
NC Central is riding high coming off the best season in program history. The Eagles finished with a conference record of 25-5, good enough for promotion and a trip to the NCAA D3 tournament. The 12 seeded Eagles went on a Cinderella run to the elite before falling by 2 to the eventual champions Lousiana Tech. Despite the loss, 3rd-year head coach Sal Schrock had nothing but praise for his team in the post-game press conference. "There is not an ounce of disappointment, bitterness, or regret in my heart. The only thing I feel is proud of these young men and what they've accomplished."<br />
<br />
Durham is buzzing with anticipation for NC Central's return to D2 next year. All but one player from the 2021 team returns, and with Ramon Valdes and Bernardo Murillo coming off their redshirt years, the team is flush with talent at all levels. AD Thomas Poole firmly believes that this team has what it takes to promote again next season and enter D1 for the first time in program history.<br />

Mar 10 2018:  <b>Tough Times and New Beginnings</b> - <i>by thpoole on April 1st, 2021</i> <br /><br />
After yet another middling season and another disastrous recruiting window for the Eagles, it was announced this week that former UNC Charlotte AD Thomas Poole would be stepping out of retirement to take over at North Carolina Central.<br />
<br />
Poole emphasized stability in his introductory press conference, stating "We need to get some bodies in the door and prevent this program from backsliding into Division 3 before we talk about bigger aspirations"<br />
<br />
Poole also suggested that the staff were looking at some late additions to the current recruiting class of Gilbert Dial and Odell Haynes, specifically some threats on the glass. Though top scorer Kwame Smith is returning for his senior season, the teams 2 leading rebounders are both graduating. Poole acknowledged that NC Central was in for a tough season in 2019, but looked forward to bringing in an exciting class in 2020 and getting things back on track. <br /><br /><br />
