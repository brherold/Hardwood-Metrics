Oct 10 2041:  <b>Trouble in Paradise (Hamden, CT)?</b> - <i>by kincaidrobinson on October 22nd, 2024</i> <br /><br />
The season hasn't begun but that hasn't stopped the Quinnipiac Men's Basketball Team from making some news.<br />
<br />
During today's preseason scrimmage against Southern Vermont the Bobcats' Coach Barton could be seen roaming the sidelines in a state best described as "animated frustration". Program insiders report that the 6th year coach was "deeply disturbed" by the performance of his underclassmen. Following the 40 point defeat he was overheard telling Assistant Coach Don Turner to "Stop trying to recruit future Doctors and Lawyers and start getting me some kids that can shoot".<br />
<br />
Quinnipiac heads into the campaign on the back of 3 consecutive 27+ win seasons, but future expectations may need to be tempered if developmental woes aren't addressed. <br /><br /><br />

Mar 14 2037:  <b>Interview with Quinnipiac’s Head of Basketball Operations</b> - <i>by kincaidrobinson on February 29th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Q: This season in Division 2 was rough - what are the programs takeaways from a 13-28 season?<br />
<br />
A: We anticipated this year would be challenging. Quinnipiac is a rebuilding program, and I think it’s fair to say the emphasis is on getting the right guys in and maximizing their development. There’s some lag in the results when recruitment is the number one priority. We will be able to better judge the outcome of today’s effort in two to three seasons.<br />
<br />
Q: On the topic of recruiting, Quinnipiac brings in a five man class this year, a three man class the year prior - how would you rate the programs performance in that area?<br />
<br />
A: We’re certainly pleased.. when we took over a couple years back, nearly 3/4’s of our scholarship players were upperclassmen. You’ll see that rebalance pretty dramatically next year, when we’ll only have one scholarship player between our Jr and Sr classes. We’ve also been really efficient as a recruiting staff so far - very low miss rate on targets from a commitment perspective. As far as development and on court performance, we just don’t have the data to make a judgement yet. But for a team of our caliber, we believe these are the right guys.<br />
<br />
Q: Recruiting in a rebuild, is it driven by need or by fit?<br />
<br />
A: I mean, the only way to answer that is to say it’s both. Our program needed bodies to play - we’re fortunate to have been able to bring 8 in over two years. And by leveraging redshirts we’re trying to stagger our classes with a little bit more… technique. We had gaps at every position - guard, wing, post, they all needed to be backfilled. And that’s not to say we recruited anybody - we’ve got positional talent profiles set for our current goals, we’re seeking out players that meet that profile, and we’re adjusting our future recruitment based off of an anticipated trajectory.<br />
<br />
Q: We’ve spent a lot of time talking about the future, but what do you have to say to the four seniors departing the program this season?<br />
<br />
A: We really wish them the best, and we’re grateful for the effort and tenacity they showed both in our previous promotion campaign and in this disappointing year. It’s unfortunate for them, I don’t think the previous organization did a good job setting them up for success. They were almost out there by themselves this season. My staff and I are doing our best to ensure that future classes don’t have the same struggles. <br /><br /><br />

Feb 28 2036:  <b>On the Back of Defeat, Quinnipiac Looks Toward a Murky Future</b> - <i>by kincaidrobinson on December 31st, 2023</i> <br /><br />
Today the Bobcats were completely outclassed in a showdown with conference leading San Jose State. While promotion has been secured, any chance of finishing first has now evaporated.<br />
<br />
Under new leadership, the team started the season with muted ambition, aspiring first and foremost to be competitive. By the halfway mark that bar was more than exceeded, and the resulting second place finish will not go unappreciated. But while students and fans celebrate, the attitude among leadership remains realistically sober.<br />
<br />
A long neglected recruiting apparatus, imbalanced team building, and a general lack of vision have left the program in a far weaker position than their recent season would indicate. It will take years of patient work to rehabilitate the team. The present success is being savored, but tough seasons lay ahead. The challenge of retaining a hard won promotion is the first obstacle.<br />
<br />
Only dogged persistence on and off the court can hope to see us through the lean years ahead. <br /><br /><br />
