Nov 09 2041:  <b>Albany Delivers Shock to Methodist, “Kennesaw State type stuff”.</b> - <i>by Fireballer34 on October 31st, 2024</i> <br /><br />
Albany’s basketball program has been mediocre for years, its finest moment coming when a core of Hall of Fame players led them to D1. “We coulda gone all the way that year” reflects Mike Ventura. They have since lost all those stars, and this year represents the first in what seems to be a rebuilding stint for Albany.<br />
<br />
That is why it was so shocking that this afternoon, the Great Danes showed up at their home stadium with a crowd of 7100 fans watching, and trounced the Monarchs 99-68. Former JuCo Guard James Slack dominated, recording a double-double with 35 points, sinking an impressive 7-10 from deep. “It was a career game for me, and it really just came at the perfect time” Slack said after the game. Forward Lew Edgar also came up clutch with a double-double. After the game, coach C.C. Dykes was ecstatic, telling a reporter “I beat some solid teams in my career, but this has to be the best one. I don’t know what happened, but that was some Kennesaw State type stuff.” To add to the irony, Albany happens to play Kennesaw State tomorrow, although they don’t play Liberty this season. “Maybe we’ll turn it around this season” said Slack of the 3-5 Great Danes, “but until then I’m content with this victory.”<br /><br /><br />

Oct 04 2040:  <b>Creech, Ventura Inducted, Finally back in D1</b> - <i>by Fireballer34 on August 26th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
After a tumultuous stretch where the Danes remained in D2 and 3, Albany has earned their first promotion to D1 since Fireballer34 took the reigns of this team. Yet this year, many new (and unproven) faces litter the Great Dane locker room. 3 of last years starters that took this team to the D2 tournament have graduated, and 2 have now been inducted to the Albany HOF. “Gordon gave everything he had on the court, his determination always amazed me.” C.C. Dykes said of newly minted hall of famer Gordon Creech. Also inducted was enforcer Mike Ventura, one of the most physical players of the era. The tandem of big men took this team from D3 to D1, destroying any opponents in their paths (except for those pesky NYU Violets). Yet arguably the two most important players from last year are returning. All Conference PG Allen Ridley had a historic season last year, setting the Albany record for Single Season points. Former 4* forward Marshall Lyons also returns, hoping to earn the elusive All Conference selection. But the other 3 starters are much less proven. At SG, former JUCO James Slack starts his first year in college, as a Junior. He has high expectations. At SF Jamie Bell will get his first starting minutes. He goes into his RS SO year and has stayed under the radar thus far, but will undoubtedly need to show a spark if the Danes hope to play a second season in IV. And at the Center position, Lew Edgar and Lloyd Biddle have BIG shoes to fill (no literally). They will split time at Center this year, with Edgar showing his scoring ability, and Biddle snatching rebounds like he does so well. Fans are wary about these new players but have hope that the two stars will dominate, and bring the Danes glory again.<br /><br /><br />

Apr 02 2039:  <b>End of this year, start of next</b> - <i>by Fireballer34 on June 27th, 2024</i> <br /><br />
The Albany Great Danes had a wildly successful year this year. Capped off by a final four tournament run, this was a very exciting year for fans. Senior Bert Moran had an outstanding year at point guard, and rumors have circulated that he may be inducted into the Albany hall of fame next year. “I am honored to have had the chance to play in the HOCB tournament with this awesome team around me.” Moran said. “I know Allen is ready to fill my shoes, he is already better than me!” Allen Ridley, who played mostly SG this year while Moran played the point, was also critical in the run as he shot very well and got a lot of assists. “He will be great at PG next year.” Said longtime coach C.C. Dykes. “The guy is a competitor.” Ridley has said that he is sad to see the Danes great go, but is excited to lead the team in D2 next year. Ridley enters his Junior year next season.<br />
<br />
Here is the projected starting lineup in 2040.<br />
<br />
PG: Allen Ridley JR<br />
<br />
SG: Frankie Sullinger SR<br />
Has played SF his entire career but Marshall Lyons became a star there, forcing Sullinger to move to SG.<br />
<br />
SF: Marshall Lyons JR<br />
Can play a variety of positions but is best suited at SF, where he can show off his multitude of talents.<br />
<br />
PF: Gordon Creech SR<br />
Some say he’s too short for the position, but he plays with the heart of a lion, snatching over 9 rebounds a game last year.<br />
<br />
C: Mike Ventura SR<br />
He’s got the height for the position. Big man till the end, he can score inside and play some nice defense.<br />
<br />
