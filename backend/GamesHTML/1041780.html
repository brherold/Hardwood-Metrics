<b>1st Half:</b><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>20:00 - Game Event: </b>Tip-off!  Manhattan gains possession on the jump ball... <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>19:55 - Manhattan: </b>Billings brings up the ball against a zone defense.   Billings passes the ball to Walker on the perimeter. Walker tries to drive to the basket, but is stopped.   Walker passes the ball to Corcoran in the paint. Corcoran shoots in the paint.  The shot goes in!   Assisted by Walker.   And Corcoran is fouled on the shot, will shoot an added free throw.
